The output (if any) follows:

Some weights of the model checkpoint at /cluster/project/sachan/abhinav/saved_models/gpt2-large were not used when initializing GPT2LMHeadModel: ['score.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing GPT2LMHeadModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing GPT2LMHeadModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
