Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but , unexpectedly , so are heatwaves . The bottom line is there ’ s no solid connection between climate change and many major indicators of extreme weather that politicians keep talking about , such as hurricanes , tornadoes , droughts , rainfall and floods , despite Trudeau ’ s claims to the contrary .

1468,"A new report published by a team of prominent climate scientists confirms what many skeptics have pointed out for years : the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming `` hiatus , '' over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures .
