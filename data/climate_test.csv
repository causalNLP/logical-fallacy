More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’ s probably true throughout the Arctic .

As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring , they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast . And while it ’ s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice .

Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss .

Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century .

Nothing substantial has changed .

Globally there ’ s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts , hurricanes and floods . Some regions experience more , some less and some no trend . Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another . There ’ s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity . If anything , the past 50 years has been relatively quiet . There ’ s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S . Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally . Since 1965 , more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase . And from 1940 to today , flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent .

In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement , the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven ’ t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don ’ t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe , and why we haven ’ t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “ the environmental uncanny. ” “ Consider , for example , the stories that congeal around questions like , ‘ Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell ? ’ or ‘ Where were you on 9/11 ? ’ ” he writes . “ Will it ever be possible to ask , in the same vein , ‘ Where were you at 400 ppm ? ’ or ‘ Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up ? ’ ” His answer : Probably not , because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves , especially in novels , which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate .

Surely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it . In a six-degree-warmer world , the Earth ’ s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “ weather ” : a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts , the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations . The strongest hurricanes will come more often , and we ’ ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them ; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently , and hail rocks will quadruple in size . Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future ; going forward , we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past . Early naturalists talked often about “ deep time ” — the perception they had , contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin , of the profound slowness of nature . What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “ dreamtime , ” or “ everywhen ” : the semi-mythical experience , described by Aboriginal Australians , of encountering , in the present moment , an out-of-time past , when ancestors , heroes , and demigods crowded an epic stage .

But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades ; since the end of World War II , the figure is 85 percent . Which means that , in the length of a single generation , global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe , and that the story of the industrial world ’ s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime .

Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year . The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year , the isolated nature of the incident , and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously .

That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world . But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000 , or about 26,000 , up slightly from 20,000-25,000 , or about 22,500 , in 2005 .

It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases . More formally , it is defined as the increase , in degrees Celsius , of average temperatures around the world , after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change . The reason it ’ s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change .

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius , but it can ’ t be more precise than that . Which is too bad , because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value . People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say , less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and , in many places , mildly beneficial . If it is very low , for instance around one , it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about . But if ECS is high — say , around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem . We may not be able to stop it , but we ’ d better get ready to adapt to it .

Moreover , Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear ’ s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears ’ prey .

Consequently , many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals ( the primary prey of polar bears ) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season , which is particularly conducive to fishing : These seals do most of their feeding in summer . More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’ s probably true throughout the Arctic .

As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring , they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast . And while it ’ s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice .",faulty generalization

We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred . It should go without saying that if scientists can not yet make accurate predictions about future climate change , then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete .

Earth ’ s climate system is unfathomably complex . It is affected by innumerable interacting variables , atmospheric CO2 levels being just one . The more variables there are in any system or train of events , the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass .

For that , the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant , drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping . At seven degrees of warming , that would become impossible for large portions of the planet ’ s equatorial band , and especially the tropics , where humidity adds to the problem ; in the jungles of Costa Rica , for instance , where humidity routinely tops 90 percent , simply moving around outside when it ’ s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal . And the effect would be fast : Within a few hours , a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out .

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before , but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow , even by the standards of planetary history . At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

Actually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit .

Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent . Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century , we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them . And proteins are worse : It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat , butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts .

Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature , and they are right — theoretically , a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland . But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown , the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain , and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity . And you can ’ t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles , because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there ; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt .

Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat , with some of the world ’ s most arable land turning quickly to desert . Precipitation is notoriously hard to model , yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous : unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced . By 2080 , without dramatic reductions in emissions , southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought , much worse than the American dust bowl ever was . The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East ; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia , Africa , and South America ; and the breadbasket regions of China . None of these places , which today supply much of the world ’ s food , will be reliable sources of any . As for the original dust bowl : The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s , a 2015 NASA study predicted , but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300 , which “ dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains ” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization .",faulty generalization

Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of “ the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. ” He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord , and who has appointed fossil-fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency .

Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions . It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming .

In the geological past , Earth ’ s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes . The past shows that climate change is normal , that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill .

Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming , the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide . The zenith of the Little Ice Age was 300 years ago and since then we have slightly warmed and cooled during a long-term warming trend .

Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer , as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today . This ought to be a cause for great joy .

Instead , the BBC focused on warning that the paper shouldn ’ t make us stop worrying about global warming , with threats like melting glaciers and more severe tropical storms . Many other major news outlets did not even report on the study .

Our climate conversation is lopsided . There is ample room to suggest that climate change has caused this problem or that negative outcome , but any mention of positives is frowned upon .

On a global scale , as scientists keep confirming , there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms , floods or droughts , while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer , thanks to modern technology and infrastructure . Arctic sea ice has recently melted more in summer than it used to in the 1980s , but Antarctic sea ice has increased , and Antarctica is gaining land-based ice , according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology . Sea level continues its centuries-long slow rise—about a foot a century—with no sign of recent acceleration .

Perhaps it is the predictions that worry the world leaders . Here , we are often told by journalists that the science is “ settled ” and there is no debate . But scientists disagree : They say there is great uncertainty , and they reflected this uncertainty in their fifth and latest assessment for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer by the latter part of the century—that is , anything from mildly beneficial to significantly harmful .

As for the impact of that future warming , a new study by a leading climate economist , Richard Tol of the University of Sussex , concludes that warming may well bring gains , because carbon dioxide causes crops and wild ecosystems to grow greener and more drought-resistant . In the long run , the negatives may outweigh these benefits , says Mr. Tol , but “ the impact of climate change does not significantly deviate from zero until 3.5°C warming . ”",equivocation

( Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent . ) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record ?

Pruitt got it right : Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “ very challenging. ” The science is far from settled .

Moreover , even if global warming expanded Lyme Disease range , one must look at the totality of global warming ’ s impact on the range of viruses and diseases . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports Lyme Disease “ is rare as a cause of death in the United States. ” According to the CDC , Lyme Disease is a contributing factor to less than 25 deaths per year in the United States . Indeed , during a recent five-year span examined by the CDC , “ only 1 [ death ] record was consistent with clinical manifestations of Lyme Disease. ” Any attempts to claim global warming will cause a few more Lyme Disease deaths must be weighed against the 36,000 Americans who are killed by the flu each year . The U.S. National Institutes of Health have documented how influenza is aided and abetted by cold climate . Any attempt to connect a warmer climate to an increase in Lyme Disease must be accompanied by an acknowledgement of a warmer climate ’ s propensity to reduce influenza incidence and mortality . The net impact of a warmer climate on viruses and diseases such as Lyme Disease and influenza is substantially beneficial and life-saving .

At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

Actually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit . As soon as several decades from now , the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year .

It is not just the hajj , and it is not just Mecca ; heat is already killing us . In the sugarcane region of El Salvador , as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease , including over a quarter of the men , the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago . With dialysis , which is expensive , those with kidney failure can expect to live five years ; without it , life expectancy is in the weeks .
