{"id": 724, "data": "The science and data strongly support that our planet ’ s ecosystems are thriving and that humanity is benefiting from modestly increasing temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide . These facts refute the claim that Earth is spiraling into one man-made climate catastrophe after another .\n\nCarbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is portrayed as a demon molecule fueling run-away greenhouse warming . If you get your news only from mainstream media , you would likely believe that CO2 levels are dangerously high and unprecedented . You would be wrong . Concentrations of this gas are slightly less than 420 parts-per-million ( ppm ) , or one-sixth the average historic levels of 2,600 ppm for the last 600 million years .\n\nIncreases in carbon dioxide in the last 150 years , largely from the burning of fossil fuels , have reversed a dangerous downward trend in the gas ’ concentration . During the last glacial period , concentrations nearly reached the “ line of death ” at 150 parts per million , below which plants die . Viewed in the long-term geologic context , we are actually CO2 impoverished .\n\nThe most recent claim from the purveyors of climate catastrophe is that recent temperature increases are “ unusual and unprecedented. ” However , records indicate that modern warming began more than 300 years ago in the depths of the horrific Little Ice Age . The first 250 years of that warming preceded 20th century CO2 increases and were necessarily 100 % naturally driven .\n\nContext is important when reviewing climate and temperature data . Assertions that the last month or year or decade were the “ hottest on record ” can be true only if your “ record ” is limited to 150 years or so .\n\nLonger-term data reveal multiple warming periods since the end of the last major ice age 10,000 years ago , each warmer than today . There is a strong correlation between the rise and fall of temperature and the ebb and flow of civilizations . During the last three warm periods dating back 6,000 years to the advent of the first great civilizations , humanity prospered and great empires arose . Intervening cold periods brought crop failure , famine , and mass depopulation . History advises us to welcome warmth and fear cold .\n\nModestly warming temperature and increasing carbon dioxide lead to longer growing seasons and more productive harvests . The world ’ s remarkable ability to increase food production year after year is attributable to mechanization , agricultural innovation , CO2 fertilization , and warmer weather . Crop and food production has seen only positive effects from relatively small changes in the global climate .\n\nContrary to sensational media reports , extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased more than 98 % over the last 100 years . Twenty times as many people die from cold as from heat , according to a worldwide review of 74 million temperature-related deaths by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini and a team of physicians . Global warming saves lives .\n\nOn nearly every key topic , evidence presented in voluminous peer-reviewed studies shows that the “ consensus ” opinion promoted by climate-apocalypse alarmists is consistently at odds with reality . Rather than a world declining into an inescapable man-made climate hell , Earth ’ s ecosystems and inhabitants are thriving because of increasing CO2 and rising temperatures not in spite of them .\n\nDuring this period of increasing CO2 and slight warming , we have seen increasing food production , soil moisture , crop growth , and a “ greening ” of the Earth . All the while droughts , forest fires , heat waves , and temperature-related deaths have declined substantially . Only the radical worldview of environmental extremists could ignore the benefits of atmospheric changes while embracing harmful economic policies based on failed climate models .\n\nYes , there is such a thing as the greenhouse effect . Yes , there has been some warming , but it has been minuscule compared to the temperature change all of us experience in the course of a day . Some part of this warming may well have been human-caused . These are matters of widespread agreement . What changes the future holds are hardly certain , but judging from the past , they too will be small .\n\nBut no , past and possible future warming does not mean that catastrophe will follow , or that measures to prevent global warming are scientifically and economically justified , or that the American values of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be blamed for the supposed “ crisis ” —still less that they should be destroyed because of highly questionable science .", "label": [[2953, 2981, "False Causality"], [3257, 3379, "Faulty Generalization"], [690, 708, "Faulty Generalization"], [0, 186, "Faulty Generalization"], [187, 293, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3545, 3659, "Intentional"], [4196, 4217, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4597, 4624, "Ad Hominem"], [4432, 4543, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4432, 4585, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [389, 436, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [682, 708, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [944, 961, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1261, 1305, "Equivocation"], [1446, 1468, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2953, 2981, "Logical Fallacy"], [1014, 1054, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1688, 1820, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1821, 2165, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2166, 2217, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2671, 2767, "False Causality"], [2770, 2952, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/apr/21/there-is-no-climate-emergency/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/gregory-wrightstone-article-in-the-washington-times-presents-list-of-false-and-misleading-statements-about-the-impacts-of-co2-and-climate-change-co2-coalition/"}
{"id": 725, "data": "Physicist Steven Koonin kicks the hornet ’ s nest right out of the gate in “ Unsettled. ” In the book ’ s first sentences he asserts that “ the Science ” about our planet ’ s climate is anything but “ settled. ” Mr. Koonin knows well that it is nonetheless a settled subject in the minds of most pundits and politicians and most of the population .\nFurther proof of the public ’ s sentiment : Earlier this year the United Nations Development Programme published the mother of all climate surveys , titled “ The Peoples ’ Climate Vote. ” With more than a million respondents from 50 countries , the survey , unsurprisingly , found “ 64 % of people said that climate change was an emergency . ”\nBut science itself is not conducted by polls , regardless of how often we are urged to heed a “ scientific consensus ” on climate . As the science-trained novelist Michael Crichton summarized in a famous 2003 lecture at Caltech : “ If it ’ s consensus , it isn ’ t science . If it ’ s science , it isn ’ t consensus . Period. ” Mr. Koonin says much the same in “ Unsettled . ”\nThe book is no polemic . It ’ s a plea for understanding how scientists extract clarity from complexity . And , as Mr. Koonin makes clear , few areas of science are as complex and multidisciplinary as the planet ’ s climate .\nHe begins with a kind of trigger warning for readers who may be shocked by the book ’ s contradiction of four points of climate orthodoxy : “ Heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900 ” and “ the warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past fifty years . . . . Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century . . . . Greenland ’ s ice sheet isn ’ t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago . . . . The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century . ”\nBut Mr. Koonin is no “ climate denier , ” to use the concocted phrase used to shut down debate . The word “ denier ” is of course meant to associate skeptics of climate alarmism with Holocaust deniers . Mr. Koonin finds this label particularly abhorrent , since “ the Nazis killed more than two hundred of my relatives in Eastern Europe. ” As for “ denying , ” Mr. Koonin makes it clear , on the book ’ s first page , that “ it ’ s true that the globe is warming , and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it . ”\nThe heart of the science debate , however , isn ’ t about whether the globe is warmer or whether humanity contributed . The important questions are about the magnitude of civilization ’ s contribution and the speed of changes ; and , derivatively , about the urgency and scale of governmental response . Mr. Koonin thinks most readers will be surprised at what the data show . I dare say they will .\nAs Mr Koonin illustrates , tornado frequency and severity are also not trending up ; nor are the number and severity of droughts . The extent of global fires has been trending significantly downward . The rate of sea-level rise has not accelerated . Global crop yields are rising , not falling . And while global atmospheric CO2 levels are obviously higher now than two centuries ago , they ’ re not at any record planetary high—they ’ re at a low that has only been seen once before in the past 500 million years .\nMr. Koonin laments the sloppiness of those using local weather “ events ” to make claims about long-cycle planetary phenomena . He chastises not so much local news media as journalists with prestigious national media who should know better . This attribution error evokes one of Mr. Koonin ’ s rare rebukes : “ Pointing to hurricanes as an example of the ravages of human-caused climate change is at best unconvincing , and at worst plainly dishonest . ”\nWhen it comes to the vaunted computer models , Mr. Koonin is persuasively skeptical . It ’ s a big problem , he says , when models can ’ t retroactively “ predict ” events that have already happened . And he notes that some of the “ tuning ” done to models so that they work better amounts to “ cooking the books. ” He should know , having written one of the first textbooks on using computers to model physics phenomena .\nMr. Koonin ’ s science credentials are impeccable—unlike , say , those of one well-known Swedish teenager to whom the media affords great attention on climate matters . He has been a professor of physics at Caltech and served as the top scientist in Barack Obama ’ s Energy Department . The book is copiously referenced and relies on widely accepted government documents .\nSince all the data that Mr. Koonin uses are available to others , he poses the obvious question : “ Why haven ’ t you heard these facts before ? ” He is cautious , perhaps overly so , in proposing the causes for so much misinformation . He points to such things as incentives to invoke alarm for fundraising purposes and official reports that “ mislead by omission. ” Many of the primary scientific reports , he observes repeatedly , are factual . Still , “ the public gets their climate information almost exclusively from the media ; very few people actually read the assessment summaries . ”\nMr. Koonin says that he knows he ’ ll be criticized , even “ attacked. ” You can ’ t blame him for taking a few pages to shadow box with his critics . But even if one remains unconvinced by his arguments , the right response is to debate the science . We ’ ll see if that happens in a world in which politicians assert the science is settled and plan astronomical levels of spending to replace the nation ’ s massive infrastructures with “ green ” alternatives . Never have so many spent so much public money on the basis of claims that are so unsettled . The prospects for a reasoned debate are not good . Good luck , Mr. Koonin .\nMr. Mills , a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute , is the author of “ Digital Cathedrals ” and a forthcoming book on how the cloud and new technologies will create an economic boom .", "label": [[925, 1010, "False Dilemma"], [1438, 1504, "Intentional"], [2952, 3019, "Intentional"], [3071, 3117, "Intentional"], [1513, 1892, "Intentional"], [3916, 3992, "Intentional"], [3022, 3068, "Intentional"], [2848, 2951, "Intentional"], [2847, 2951, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3127, 3336, "Intentional"], [693, 824, "Intentional"], [1992, 2097, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2157, 2234, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3305, 3334, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3337, 3578, "Ad Hominem"], [3646, 3791, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [4108, 4214, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4265, 4381, "Ad Hominem"], [4215, 4383, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4688, 4732, "Intentional"], [5435, 5645, "Intentional"], [1321, 1336, "Ad Hominem"]], "source_url": "https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/unsettled-review-theconsensus-on-climate-11619383653", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-article-repeats-multiple-incorrect-and-misleading-claims-made-in-steven-koonins-new-book-unsettled-steven-koonin/"}
{"id": 729, "data": "There is no “ climate emergency ” , according to a study for the Global Warming Policy Foundation by independent scientist Dr Indur Goklany .\n\nGoklany concludes :\n\nWhile climate may have changed for the warmer :\n\n• Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme , more deadly , or more destructive\n\n• Empirical evidence directly contradicts claims that increased carbon dioxide has reduced human wellbeing . In fact , human wellbeing has never been higher\n\n• Whatever detrimental effects warming and higher carbon dioxide may have had on terrestrial species and ecosystems , they have been swamped by the contribution of fossil fuels to increased biological productivity . This has halted , and turned around , reductions in habitat loss\n\nThe report will make hugely depressing reading for all the prominent environmental activists — from the Pope and Doom Goblin Greta Thunberg to the Great Reset ’ s Klaus Schwab — who have been pushing the “ climate emergency ” narrative . It is an article of faith for the globalist elite and their useful idiots in the media , in politics , in business , and the entertainment that the world is on course for climate disaster which only radical and costly international action can prevent .\n\nBut Goklany ’ s report — Impacts of Climate Change : Perception & Reality — claims there is little if any evidence to support the scare narrative .\n\nAt the end , Goklany provides a table , setting out all the scaremongering claims made by environmental groups — and then comparing them with observed reality . Only one of the claims stands up , according to the study — weather has been getting slightly warmer :\n\nMore hot days and fewer cold days — Yes\n\nCyclones/hurricanes more intense or frequent — No\n\nTornadoes increase and become more intense — No\n\nFloods more frequent and more intense — No\n\nDroughts more frequent and intense — No\n\nArea burned by wildfire increasing — No ( area peaked in mid-19th century )\n\nCereal yields decreasing — No ( they have tripled since 1961 )\n\nFood supplies per capita decreasing — No ( increased 31 per cent since 1961 )\n\nLand area and beaches shrinking , coral islands submerged — No . ( Marginal expansion )\n\nNone of the doom-mongering claims made about a decline in human welfare stands up , either , according to the study .\n\nAccess to cleaner water has increased ; mortality from ‘ Extreme Weather Events ’ has declined by 99 per cent since the 1920s ; fewer people are dying from heat ; death rates from climate-sensitive diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have decreased ( since 1900 malaria death rates have declined 96 per cent ) ; hunger rates have declined ; poverty has declined ( GDP per capita has quadrupled since 1950 even as CO2 levels have sextupled ) ; life expectancy has more than doubled since the start of industrialisation ; health adjusted life expectancy has increased ; global inequality has decreased in terms of incomes , life expectancies and access to modern-day amenities ; the earth is green and more productive ; habitat lost to agriculture has peaked due to fossil fuel dependent technologies .\n\nIt will be hard for green activists to dismiss Goklany as a “ denier ” . His credentials as a climate expert are impeccable . He was a member of the U.S. delegation that established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and helped develop its First Assessment Report . He subsequently served as a U.S. delegate to the IPCC , and as an IPCC reviewer .\n\nGoklany says :\n\nAlmost everywhere you look , climate change is having only small , and often benign , impacts . The impact of extreme weather events ― hurricanes , tornadoes , floods and droughts ― are , if anything , declining . Economic damages have declined as a fraction of global GDP . Death rates from such events have declined by 99 % since the 1920s . Climate-related disease has collapsed . And more people die from cold than warm temperatures .\n\nEven sea-level rise — predicted to be the most damaging impact of global warming — seems to be much less of a problem than thought , according to to the study ’ s findings .\n\nGoklany says :\n\nA recent study showed that the Earth has actually gained more land in coastal areas in the last 30 years than it has lost through sea-level rise . We now know for sure that coral atolls aren ’ t disappearing and even Bangladesh is gaining more land through siltation than it is losing through rising seas .\n\nIn his report , Goklany destroys many of the green movement ’ s shibboleths , including the notion that fossil fuels are bad for the planet . Not only , he suggests , has their CO2 contributed to “ global greening ” — “ contrary to prevailing wisdom , tree cover globally has increased by over 2 million km2 between 1982 and 2016 , an increase of 7 per cent ” — but they provide the fertilisers and pesticides which simultaneously feed the planet and reduce the amount of land required for agriculture :\n\nThus , nitrogen fertilisers and carbon dioxide fertilisation have together increased global food production by 111 per cent . In other words , fossil fuels are responsible for more than half of global food production . Without them , food would be scarcer , and prices higher ( assuming all else , including food demand , stays constant ) . To maintain the food supply , croplands would have to more than double , to at least 26 per cent of the world ’ s land area ( ex-Antarctica ) . Adding in pastureland , the human footprint on the planet would increase to 51.2 per cent of the world . In other words , fossil fuels have saved 13.8 per cent of the non-frozen parts of the world from being converted to agriculture .\n\nAt the beginning , he quotes a number of climate doom-mongers , including the Pope . According to the Pope :\n\nThe effects of global inaction are startling…Around the world , we are seeing heat waves , droughts , forest fires , floods and other extreme meteorological events , rising sea levels , emergencies of diseases and further problems that are only premonition of things far worse , unless we act and act urgently .\n\nMaybe it ’ s time the Pope looked at some actual evidence…", "label": [[215, 245, "Intentional"], [865, 891, "Ad Hominem"], [1050, 1063, "Ad Hominem"], [421, 468, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [314, 468, "False Causality"], [3187, 3481, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [6087, 6145, "Ad Hominem"], [1453, 1467, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [36, 139, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1843, 1877, "Intentional"], [1884, 1918, "Intentional"], [1961, 1985, "Intentional"], [2025, 2060, "Intentional"], [2104, 2161, "Intentional"], [2312, 2349, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2624, 2934, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2933, 3112, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3595, 3712, "Intentional"], [2880, 3112, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2312, 2440, "Intentional"], [2624, 2832, "Intentional"], [2832, 2988, "Intentional"], [2989, 3112, "Intentional"], [5533, 5662, "Intentional"], [4943, 5068, "Intentional"], [5035, 5039, "Logical Fallacy"], [5051, 5053, "Logical Fallacy"], [5705, 5725, "Ad Hominem"], [431, 468, "Intentional"], [588, 685, "Intentional"], [1750, 1792, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1699, 1744, "Intentional"], [1799, 1836, "Intentional"], [2352, 2624, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [5040, 5050, "Logical Fallacy"], [4615, 4798, "Intentional"], [4615, 4666, "Intentional"], [215, 310, "Intentional"], [2312, 2623, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2624, 2880, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2977, 3029, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2440, 2624, "Intentional"], [5004, 5058, "Intentional"], [5035, 5039, "Intentional"], [5004, 5057, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/02/07/delingpole-study-disputes-earth-climate-emergency/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-makes-numerous-false-claims-about-the-impacts-of-climate-change-based-on-global-warming-policy-foundation-post-delingpole-goklany/"}

{"id": 731, "data": "Scientists say they have found evidence that frozen methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean have started to be released over a large area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast , the Guardian can reveal .\n\nHigh levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia , prompting concern among researchers that the discovery could have “ serious climate consequences ” .\n\nThe slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases – known as hydrates . Methane has a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years . The United States Geological Survey has previously listed Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change .\n\nThe international team onboard the Russian research ship R/V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere .\n\n“ At this moment , there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming , but the point is that this process has now been triggered . This East Siberian slope methane hydrate system has been perturbed and the process will be ongoing , ” said the Swedish scientist Örjan Gustafsson , of Stockholm University , in a satellite call from the vessel .\n\nThe scientists – who are part of a multi-year International Shelf Study Expedition – stressed their findings were preliminary . Methane seeps detected in the past were found to be historic , but the expedition believes these are new based on an earlier study showing movement of the subsea permafrost between the early 1980s and 2015 . The scale of methane releases will not be confirmed until they return , analyse the data and have their studies published in a peer-reviewed journal .\n\nBut the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns about the potential impact on the speed of global heating .\n\nThe Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits – which have been called the “ sleeping giants of the carbon cycle ” - in the ocean , and if releases were to exceed a tipping point it could increase the speed of global heating .\n\nWith the Arctic temperature now rising more than twice as fast as the global average , the question of when – or even whether – they will be released into the atmosphere has been a matter of considerable uncertainty in climate computer models .\n\nThe 60-member team on the Akademik Keldysh believe they are the first to observationally confirm the methane release is already under way across a wide area of the slope about 600km offshore .\n\nAt six monitoring points over a slope area 150km in length and 10km wide , they saw clouds of bubbles released from sediment .\n\nAt one location on the Laptev Sea slope at a depth of about 300 metres they found methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre , which is 400 times higher than would be expected if the sea and the atmosphere were in equilibrium .\n\nIgor Semiletov , of the Russian Academy of Sciences , who is the chief scientist onboard , said the discharges were “ significantly larger ” than anything found before . “ The discovery of actively releasing shelf slope hydrates is very important and unknown until now , ” he said . “ This is a new page . Potentially they can have serious climate consequences , but we need more study before we can confirm that . ”\n\nThe most likely cause of the instability is an intrusion of warm Atlantic currents into the east Arctic . This “ Atlantification ” is driven by human-induced climate disruption .\n\nThe latest discovery potentially marks the third source of methane emissions from the region . Semiletov , who has been studying this area for two decades , has previously reported the gas is being released from the shelf of the Arctic – the biggest of any sea .\n\nFor the second year in a row , his team have found crater-like pockmarks in the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that are discharging bubble jets of methane , which is reaching the sea surface at levels tens to hundreds of times higher than normal . This is similar to the craters and sinkholes reported from inland Siberian tundra earlier this autumn .\n\nTemperatures in Siberia were 5C higher than average from January to June this year , an anomaly that was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and methane .

{"id": 735, "data": "Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds , scientists have said .\n\nRecent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed , and experts said the projections had the potential to be “ incredibly alarming ” , though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers .\n\nModelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which is due to be released next year .\n\nCompared with the last assessment in 2014 , 25 % of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million . This has shocked many veteran observers , because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s .\n\n“ That is a very deep concern , ” Johan Rockström , the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , said . “ Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science . It is the prime indicator of climate risk . For 40 years , it has been around 3C . Now , we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought . ”\n\nHe said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating . “ We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [ above preindustrial levels ] . The best we could aim for is 2C , ” he said .\n\nWorst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world ’ s leading climate research bodies , including the UK Met Office ’ s Hadley Centre and the EU ’ s Community Earth System Model .\n\nTimothy Palmer , a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office ’ s advisory board , said the high figure initially made scientists nervous . “ It was way outside previous estimates . People asked whether there was a bug in the code , ” he said . “ But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models . ”\n\nThe role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and , depending on altitude , droplet temperature and other factors , can play either a warming or a cooling role . For decades , this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes .\n\nPrevious IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out . But in the past year and a half , a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming . This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics .\n\n“ Clouds will determine humanity ’ s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with , ” said Palmer . “ Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse . ”\n\nIn a recent paper in the journal Nature , Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather . This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models , but in the latest case , the results reinforced the estimates . “ The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates , ” he wrote . He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way .\n\n“ It ’ s really important . The message to the government and public is , you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously . [ We ] must get emissions down as quickly as we can , ” he said .\n\nThe IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes . Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records .\n\nCatherine Senior , head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre , said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols .\n\n“ This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right , ” she said . “ But as a scientist , my first response is : why has the model done that ? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response . ”\n\nWhile acknowledging the continued uncertainty , Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere .\n\n“ The more we learn , the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move , ” he said . “ It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy . ”", "label": [[126, 136, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [157, 166, "Faulty Generalization"], [716, 721, "Intentional"], [1373, 1387, "Faulty Generalization"], [682, 759, "Intentional"], [2945, 2984, "Faulty Generalization"], [150, 171, "Intentional"], [1701, 1723, "Intentional"], [2083, 2090, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4754, 4852, "Logical Fallacy"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/13/climate-worst-case-scenarios-clouds-scientists-global-heating", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-in-the-guardian-misleads-readers-about-sensitivity-of-climate-models-by-narrowly-focusing-on-single-study-jonathan-watts/"}
{"id": 736, "data": "I ’ m an atmospheric physicist . I ’ ve published more than 200 scientific papers . For 30 years\nI taught at MIT , during which time the climate has changed remarkably little . But the cry\nof “ global warming ” has grown ever more shrill . In fact , it seems that the less the climate\nchanges , the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get . So , let ’ s clear the air and create a\nmore accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or , as it is now\ncalled— “ climate change . ”\nThere are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue . Groups one and two are\nscientists . Group three consists mostly , at its core , of politicians , environmentalists and the\nmedia .\nGroup one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation ’ s International Panel\non Climate Change or IPCC ( Working Group 1 ) . These are scientists who mostly believe that\nrecent climate change is primarily due to man ’ s burning of fossil fuels—oil , coal and natural\ngas . This releases C02 , carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere and , they believe , this might\neventually dangerously heat the planet .\nGroup two is made up of scientists who don ’ t see this as an especially serious problem . This\nis the group I belong to . We ’ re usually referred to as skeptics .\nWe note that there are many reasons why the climate changes—the sun , clouds , oceans ,\nthe orbital variations of the earth , as well as a myriad of other inputs . None of these is fully\nunderstood , and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor .\nBut actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists . The following are\nsuch points of agreement :\n1 ) The climate is always changing .\n2 ) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible , but adding it to the\natmosphere should lead to some warming .\n3 ) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the\n19th century .\n4 ) Over this period ( the past two centuries ) , the global mean temperature has increased\nslightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius ; but only since\nthe 1960 ’ s have man ’ s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role .\n5 ) Given the complexity of climate , no confident prediction about future global mean\ntemperature or its impact can be made . The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that\n“ The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible . ”\nMost importantly , the scenario that the burning of fossil fuel leads to catastrophe isn ’ t part of\nwhat either group asserts . So why are so many people worried , indeed , panic stricken about\nthis issue . Here ’ s where Group Three comes in—the politicians , environmentalists , and media .\nGlobal warming alarmism provides them , more than any other issue , with the things they\nmost want : For politicians it ’ s money and power . For environmentalists it ’ s money for their\norganizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a\ndestructive force acting upon nature . And for the media it ’ s ideology , money , and headlines .\nDoomsday scenarios sell .\nMeanwhile , over the last decade , scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the\nbandwagon , publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian\ncivil war . And crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have\nso lavishly provided .\nUnfortunately , group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the\nserious debate that should be going on . But while politicians , environmentalists and media\ntypes can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people , they won ’ t be able to bury the truth .\nThe climate will have the final word on that .\nI ’ m Richard Lindzen , emeritus professor of atmospheric sciences at MIT , for Prager University .\nFree Courses for Free Minds\n.\n", "label": [[133, 174, "Faulty Generalization"], [133, 174, "Intentional"], [2880, 2918, "Ad Hominem"], [3095, 3154, "Ad Hominem"], [2920, 3094, "Ad Hominem"], [0, 176, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [240, 347, "False Causality"], [221, 237, "Ad Hominem"], [1690, 1722, "Faulty Generalization"], [1751, 1794, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1972, 2138, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1972, 2235, "Logical Fallacy"], [2363, 2484, "Intentional"], [2485, 2613, "Logical Fallacy"], [2485, 2613, "Intentional"], [2640, 2673, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2779, 3154, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3285, 3374, "Intentional"], [3381, 3386, "Ad Hominem"]], "source_url": "https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3169298993112935", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/video-from-prageru-makes-several-incorrect-and-misleading-claims-about-climate-change-richard-lindzen/"}
{"id": 737, "data": "As many as half of the current world 's population could be dealing with `` unlivable heat '' by 2070 , a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed .\n\nIn the next 50 years , somewhere between 1 to 3 billion people are expected to be inflicted with unbearable heat , according to the study . By 2070 , that could be about a third of the overall global population at that time .\n\nMarten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands , an ecologist and co-author of the study , told the Associated Press the projections are `` unlivable for the ordinary , for poor people , for the average world citizen . ''\n\nThe actual number of people affected will depend on how fast the global population grows and the levels of carbon emissions , the AP reported .\n\nWhile the worst-case scenario expects over 3 billion people to be impacted , more likely scenarios from the study show that at least 1 billion people will be affected , the AP reported .\n\n`` It 's a huge amount , and it 's a short time . This is why we 're worried , '' Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald told the AP .\n\nMahowald was n't apart of the study but told the AP that `` the new study makes sense and conveys the urgency of the man-made climate change differently than past research .

{"id": 741, "data": "For decades , most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect . We now know that thinking was wrong . This summer , for instance , a heat wave in Europe penetrated the Arctic , pushing temperatures into the 80s across much of the Far North and , according to the Belgian climate scientist Xavier Fettweis , melting some 40 billion tons of Greenland ’ s ice sheet .\n\nHad a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels , at an estimated two one-hundredths of an inch , bake the Arctic and produce Sahara-like temperatures in Paris and Berlin , the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist . But many worst-case scenarios from that time are now realities .\n\nScience is a process of discovery . It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools . But in the case of climate , this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics . A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “ tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold ” and said one of the reasons was “ the perceived need for consensus. ” This has had severe consequences , diluting what should have been a sense of urgency and vastly understating the looming costs of adaptation and dislocation as the planet continues to warm .\n\nIn 1990 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries , said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace , that the methane-laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing , and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable .\n\nRelying on the climate change panel ’ s assessment , economists estimated that the economic hit would be small , providing further ammunition against an aggressive approach to reducing emissions and to building resilience to climate change .\n\nAs we now know , all of those predictions turned out to be completely wrong . Which makes you wonder whether the projected risks of further warming , dire as they are , might still be understated . How bad will things get ?\n\nSo far , the costs of underestimation have been enormous . New York City ’ s subway system did not flood in its first 108 years , but Hurricane Sandy ’ s 2012 storm surge caused nearly $ 5 billion in water damage , much of which is still not repaired . In 2017 , Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $ 125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods .\n\nThe climate change panel seems finally to have caught up with the gravity of the climate crisis . Last year , the organization detailed the extraordinary difficulty of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.5 degrees Celsius ) , over the next 80 years , and the grim consequences that will result even if that goal is met .\n\nMore likely , a separate United Nations report concluded , we are headed for warming of at least 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit . That will come with almost unimaginable damage to economies and ecosystems . Unfortunately , this dose of reality arrives more than 30 years after human-caused climate change became a mainstream issue .\n\nThe word “ upended ” does not do justice to the revolution in climate science wrought by the discovery of sudden climate change . The realization that the global climate can swing between warm and cold periods in a matter of decades or even less came as a profound shock to scientists who thought those shifts took hundreds if not thousands of years .\n\nScientists knew major volcanic eruptions or asteroid strikes could affect climate rapidly , but such occurrences were uncommon and unpredictable . Absent such rare events , changes in climate looked steady and smooth , a consequence of slow-moving geophysical factors like the earth ’ s orbital cycle in combination with the tilt of the planet ’ s axis , or shifts in the continental plates .\n\nThen , in the 1960s , a few scientists began to focus on an unusual event that took place after the last ice age . Scattered evidence suggested that the post-ice age warming was interrupted by a sudden cooling that began around 12,000 years ago and ended abruptly 1,300 years later . The era was named the Younger Dryas for a plant that proliferated during that cold period .\n\nAt first , some scientists questioned the rapidity and global reach of the cooling . A report from the National Academies of Science in 1975 acknowledged the Younger Dryas but concluded that it would take centuries for the climate to change in a meaningful way . But not everyone agreed . The climate scientist Wallace Broecker at Columbia had offered a theory that changes in ocean circulation could bring about sudden climate shifts like the Younger Dryas .\n\nAnd it was Dr. Broecker who , in 1975 , the same year as that National Academies report playing down the Younger Dryas , published a paper , titled “ Climatic Change : Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming ? ” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century . This is now seen as prophetic , but at the time , Dr. Broecker was an outlier .\n\nThen , in the early 1990s , scientists completed more precise studies of ice cores extracted from the Greenland ice sheet . Dust and oxygen isotopes encased in the cores provided a detailed climate record going back eons . It revealed that there had been 25 rapid climate change events like the Younger Dryas in the last glacial period .\n\nThe evidence in those ice cores would prove pivotal in turning the conventional wisdom . As the science historian Spencer Weart put it : “ How abrupt was the discovery of abrupt climate change ? Many climate experts would put their finger on one moment : the day they read the 1993 report of the analysis of Greenland ice cores . Before that , almost nobody confidently believed that the climate could change massively within a decade or two ; after the report , almost nobody felt sure that it could not . ”\n\nIn 2002 , the National Academies acknowledged the reality of rapid climate change in a report , “ Abrupt Climate Change : Inevitable Surprises , ” which described the new consensus as a “ paradigm shift. ” This was a reversal of its 1975 report .\n\n“ Large , abrupt climate changes have affected hemispheric to global regions repeatedly , as shown by numerous paleoclimate records , ” the report said , and added that “ changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius and a factor of 2 in precipitation have occurred in some places in periods as short as decades to years . ”\n\nThe National Academies report added that the implications of such potential rapid changes had not yet been considered by policymakers and economists . And even today , 17 years later , a substantial portion of the American public remains unaware or unconvinced it is happening .\n\nWere the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica to melt , sea levels would rise by an estimated 225 feet worldwide . Few expect that to happen anytime soon . But those ice sheets now look a lot more fragile than they did to the climate change panel in 1995 , when it said that little change was expected over the next hundred years .\n\nIn the years since , data has shown that both Greenland and Antarctica have been shedding ice far more rapidly than anticipated . Ice shelves , which are floating extensions of land ice , hold back glaciers from sliding into the sea and eventually melting . In the early 2000s , ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica , and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves . And some major glaciers are dumping ice directly into the ocean .\n\nBy 2014 , a number of scientists had concluded that an irreversible collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet had already begun , and computer modeling in 2016 indicated that its disintegration in concert with other melting could raise sea levels up to six feet by 2100 , about twice the increase described as a possible worst-case scenario just three years earlier . At that pace , some of the world ’ s great coastal cities , including New York , London and Hong Kong , would become inundated .\n\nThen this year , a review of 40 years of satellite images suggested that the East Antarctic ice sheet , which was thought to be relatively stable , may also be shedding vast amounts of ice .\n\nAs the seas rise , they are also warming at a pace unanticipated as recently as five years ago . This is very bad news . For one thing , a warmer ocean means more powerful storms , and die-offs of marine life , but it also suggests that the planet is more sensitive to increased carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought .\n\nThe melting of permafrost has also defied expectations . This is ground that has remained frozen for at least two consecutive years and covers around a quarter of the exposed land mass of the Northern Hemisphere . As recently as 1995 , it was thought to be stable . But by 2005 , the National Center for Atmospheric Research estimated that up to 90 percent of the Northern Hemisphere ’ s topmost layer of permafrost could thaw by 2100 , releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere .\n\nFor all of the missed predictions , changes in the weather are confirming earlier expectations that a warming globe would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather . And there are new findings unforeseen by early studies , such as the extremely rapid intensification of storms , as on Sept. 1 , when Hurricane Dorian ’ s sustained winds intensified from 150 to 185 miles per hour in just nine hours , and last year when Hurricane Michael grew from tropical depression to major hurricane in just two days .\n\nIf the Trump administration has its way , even the revised worst-case scenarios may turn out to be too rosy . In late August , the administration announced a plan to roll back regulations intended to limit methane emissions resulting from oil and gas exploration , despite opposition from some of the largest companies subject to those regulations . More recently , its actions approached the surreal as the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation into those auto companies that have agreed in principle to abide by higher gas mileage standards required by California . The administration also formally revoked a waiver allowing California to set stricter limits on tailpipe emissions than the federal government .\n\nEven if scientists end up having lowballed their latest assessments of the consequences of the greenhouse gases we continue to emit into the atmosphere , their predictions are dire enough . But the Trump administration has made its posture toward climate change abundantly clear : Bring it on !\n\nIt ’ s already here . And it is going to get worse . A lot worse .", "label": [[375, 674, "Intentional"], [1725, 1761, "Intentional"], [2025, 2085, "Intentional"], [2634, 2730, "Intentional"], [3182, 3289, "Intentional"], [9097, 9148, "Intentional"], [14, 71, "Faulty Generalization"], [914, 1006, "Intentional"], [1058, 1234, "Intentional"], [3423, 3644, "Intentional"], [5974, 6152, "Intentional"], [6903, 6996, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [7115, 7153, "Intentional"], [111, 372, "Intentional"], [2086, 2205, "Faulty Generalization"], [2206, 2231, "Intentional"], [2292, 2632, "Intentional"], [10306, 10340, "Ad Hominem"], [10669, 10858, "Logical Fallacy"], [10965, 11031, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/science-climate-change.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-op-ed-claiming-scientists-underestimated-climate-change-lacks-supporting-evidence-eugene-linden/"}
{"id": 742, "data": "The impact of humans on Earth is unparalleled , with scientists arguing our actions have tipped the planet into a new era - the Anthropocene - with fallout from nuclear bombs now written into the rocks beneath our feet , and species facing extinction at 1,000 times the usual rate .\n\nYet global warming could turn out to be the most devastating consequence of human progress . If temperatures continue to increase , experts forecast catastrophic sea level rises , a surge in hurricanes and cyclones , the spread of lethal disease , drought , famine and deadly heatwaves .\n\nBut does the science back up these claims ? Is carbon dioxide primarily to blame or could there be other causes ? What role do the Sun , clouds and the oceans play ?\n\nAnd , can today ’ s climate models be trusted when scientists have misrepresented the data in the past ?\n\nHere is what we know :\n\nGlobal temperature rise\n\nEarth ’ s climate has changed continually throughout its 4.5 billion year history , cycling through periods of cooling and warming , of glacial advance and retreat .\n\nThe last ice age ended around 11,700 years ago , ushering in a new temperate interglacial period - known as the Holocene - and triggering the birth of agriculture and the rise of civilisation .\n\nReliable surface temperature records have been available since around the 1850s , and it is now accepted that Earth is , indeed , warming .\n\nThe planet 's average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F ( 0.9C ) during that period , with most of the warming occurring in the past 35 years . Since 1990 , global temperatures have risen between 0.23F ( 0.13C ) and 0.34F ( 0.19C ) per decade , depending on which official data set is used .\n\nGlobally , the five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010 and , in Britain , the hottest 10 years since Met Office records began in 1884 have all happened since 2002 . None of the 10 coldest years have occurred since 1963 .\n\n\nHowever the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast .\n\nIn 1990 the United Nation 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F ( 0.3C ) per decade . Skeptics argue that the forecasts were too high because they relied too heavily on the impact of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .\n\nCO2 has indeed increased in the atmosphere , from approximately 0.03 per cent to 0.04 per cent ( or 400 parts per million , ppm ) over the past 50 years . And isotope measurements have shown that this rise is due to the burning of fossil fuels .\n\n\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas , absorbing and emitting certain frequencies of infrared radiation so it is generally accepted that man-made emissions must be having some kind of impact on global warming .\n\nYet , some scientists argue that the gas is not capable of producing the extreme temperature rises seen in recent decades .\n\nIn its 5th assessment report in 2013 , the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010 .\n\nBut it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere .\n\nThe greenhouse effect\n\nAt its heart , climate change is about electromagnetic radiation coming from the Sun . To warm up , the Earth must be trapping more energy than it is leaking back into space .\n\nIn the 1820s , the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier realised that the ‘ greenhouse effect ’ must exist , otherwise our planet would be mainly frozen .\n\nAs early as 1856 , Eunice Foote theorised that changing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would alter the planet ’ s temperature . In a paper titled ‘ Circumstances affecting the heat of the Sun ’ s rays ’ , she outlined the thermal blanket effect of CO2 .\n\nJust five years later , John Tyndall , the Irish physicist , directly measured the warming effect of CO2 , water vapour and other gases and in 1896 , the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius calculated that the Earth ’ s temperature would rise by several degrees if all the known coal in the world was burned .\n\nBy 1938 , the English steam engineer and inventor Guy Callendar suggested that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had already caused the Earth to warm and in the 1960s US scholar Roger Revelle compiled the first series of measurements showing that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were rising .\n\nEven ExxonMobil ’ s own scientists predicted in 1982 that the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and warming we would see by now if we the world did not curtail fossil fuel burning .\n\nThe gases in our atmosphere keep Earth nearly 60F ( 30C ) warmer than it would be without an atmosphere . Based on our proximity to the Sun , the planet 's surface should be at -0.4F ( -18C ) but instead its a balmy 59F ( 15C ) .\n\nDr Ed Hawkins , Professor of Climate Science , at the University of Reading , said : “ Greenhouse gases act as a blanket by making it harder for the heat to leave . The more blankets you add the warmer you get . ”\n\nHowever , some experts argue that carbon dioxide is only a minor player in this atmospheric hothouse effect . Ice cores from Antarctica show that at the end of recent ice ages , the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb .\n\nAdded to that , CO2 is only one of several greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . There is also methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride . But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour , which makes 95 per cent of the total .\n\nScientists such as Dr Willie Soon , a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , have shown that as water vapour rises , so does temperature . It is why cloudless nights are so chilly .\n\n“ These guys say if you change the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere we ’ re going to change the whole system , ” he told a meeting in the US in August .\n\n“ It ’ s a bit ridiculous actually . Correlation does not equal causation . CO2 is not powerful in that sense , the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener . Carbon Dioxide is playing a minor role in the total greenhouse effect . ”\n\nYet other scientists claim this is a red herring because of the positive feedback loop created by water vapour .\n\nAs temperatures increase , more water evaporates , and thus more water vapour is created . So if something , such as CO2 causes even a small temperature increase , more water vapour will be created , and the temperature will rise further .\n\nStudies show that water vapour feedback doubles the amount of warming caused by CO2 . Carbon dioxide also stays in the atmosphere for longer , while water vapour is short lived .\n\nDr Piers Forster , Professor of Physical Climate Change and Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds , said : “ Bizarrely it is the most fundamental physics that some climate sceptics have chosen to go after , saying that CO2 doesn ’ t absorb radiation or that the effect is masked by water vapour .\n\n“ This is a strange front to attack , as since Tyndall the absorption of CO2 has been measured not be climate scientists but by physicists and chemists in labs all over the world in precise detail . Measurements from space and on the Earth ’ s surface confirm that CO2 is absorbing more and more radiation .\n\n“ After 30 years of research into it I treat ( man-made climate change ) with as much certainty as gravity - maybe even more certainty than gravity , in fact , as I ’ ve tested man-made climate change many times with my own investigations and calculations , but only ever tested gravity by dropping heavy objects on my toe . ”\n\nSome of Dr Soon ’ s work is paid for by oil companies who clearly have a vested interest in making the blame for global warming fall elsewhere .\n\nOn the other hand academics claim it ’ s virtually impossible to get funded for work that disputes climate change through other channels . Even the BBC has admitted to Ofcom that the corporation is now biased on the matter because it no longer thinks there is a counter-argument .\n\nYet Dr Hawkins said the evidence was now irrefutable . “ Human-caused climate change is not something that one can choose to ‘ believe ’ or not .\n\n“ The overwhelming scientific evidence leads to the conclusion that humans are the dominant cause of the recent warming – a person ’ s ‘ beliefs ’ can not affect this .\n\n“ For me , one of the key pieces of evidence is the basic physics which underpins the greenhouse effect , which has been understood for over 150 years . ”\n\nThe Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age\n\nWhile dependable temperature records exist from the mid-19th century , if scientists want to study the climate before then , they must rely on proxy data from sources such as tree rings , ice cores and boreholes . And this is where much of the dispute surrounding climate change lies .\n\nOne of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) and the Little Ice Age .\n\nThe MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD , and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today , allowing grain crops to flourish , the global population to soar and wine grapes to be planted in England for the first time in hundreds of years .\n\nBut the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming .\n\nLikewise temperatures suddenly plummeted after the MWP , bringing a period of cooling known as the Little Ice Age ( 1300 - 1850AD ) , when pack ice in the North Atlantic and glaciers in Greenland began advancing southwards , and frost fairs were held on the Thames when the river froze .\n\nSkeptics claim such anomalies prove that Earth can quickly warm and cool even in the absence of carbon dioxide , and any warming today may be caused by similar natural events .\n\nThe MWP was such a fly in the ointment in the case for man-made global warming that in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC - Jonathan Overpeck - wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘ we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period . ’\n\nFour years later a paper appeared in the journal Nature showing the famous ‘ Hockey stick ’ graph of temperature data for 1,000 years , in which both the MWP and the Little Ice Age had been smoothed away . It also included a noticeable ‘ tick ’ at the end which indicated a staggering level of warming at the end of the 20th century .\n\nThe ‘ Hockey stick ’ graph was used for years by the IPCC and environmentalists including former Vice President Al Gore as proof of man-made climate change , yet it later emerged that its creator Dr Michael Mann had spliced two datasets together - tree-rings showing temperatures going back hundreds of years , then recent thermometer readings for the more recent decades .\n\nExperts argued that tree-ring data is a hopelessly flawed measure of climate as yearly growth is not just based on temperature but also rainfall , pests , and nutrients in soil . Canadian geologist , Stephen McIntyre discovered much of the data had been based American bristlecone pines – which showed a spurt in growth in the twentieth century that was not linked to climate change . The IPCC no longer includes the ‘ Hockey stick ’ chart in its reports .\n\nMore recently , studies have suggested the MWP and Little Ice Age may be localised rather than global events which is why they are absent from Dr Mann ’ s tree-ring datasets . It is possible they were caused by nearby volcanic activity or changes in ocean currents .\n\nDr Forster added : “ Any historic warm periods over the last 2,000 years were only ever a local phenomenon .\n\n“ I ’ ve spent most of my career trying to look for things other than greenhouse gases that have caused temperatures to rise , calculating the effects of volcanoes , solar changes , aviation contrails , soot emissions , water vapour in the upper atmosphere to see how they compare with greenhouse gases .\n\n“ This gives me my certainty that mankind , principally through CO2 emissions has caused the warming we observe . Nothing else I ’ ve researched has come close to matching its effect . ”\n\nYet a study published just this week , by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen , Norway , found that the natural climate system can change abruptly , without the need for any external forces .\n\nThe Norwegian team believes spontaneous cooling may have caused Arctic glaciers to grow from around 700AD even though there was little change in solar radiation or volcanic eruptions to trigger falling temperatures .\n\n“ For some time now , climate models have simulated abrupt changes that develop spontaneously '' , said physicist Dr Andreas Born .\n\n`` But often , these experiments are seen as the ugly ducklings of climate modelling . In this particular case , atmospheric changes east of Greenland triggered rapid sea-ice growth . ''\n\nAs for Dr Mann , he still stands by his work , claims that it is indisputable that carbon dioxide is behind global warming .\n\n“ For more than two centuries we have been increasing the concentration of these gases from fossil fuel burning , ” he said .\n\n“ What we would not be able to explain , scientifically , would be if the Earth were not warming up . But measurements tell us that it has warmed up—more than a degree C. It will warm more than 2C in a matter of decades if we don ’ t bring carbon emissions down dramatically . ”\n\nThe Sun\n\nThe Sun provides most of the energy on Earth and its activity waxes and wanes over an 11 year cycle . Yet within this timeframe , the Sun is constantly changing , largely because of its strange rotation .\n\nThe Sun ’ s equator spins faster than its poles , meaning a day standing at the solar pole would last around 38 Earth days , compared to just 25 days at the equator . The effect of this is to cause the Sun ’ s magnetic fields to become twisted and warped until they burst out of the surface as sunspots . The number of sunspots peaks every 11 years , hence the cycle .\n\nIn 1893 , Edward Maunder , a superintendent of the Royal Greenwich Observatory , was looking through old records when he discovered that between 1645-1715 sunspot activity had come to a virtual standstill . In fact there were fewer sunspots during that period than in an average year today , an effect so striking it was dubbed the Maunder Minimum .\n\nAs we have already seen , during this time , the Northern Hemisphere experienced ‘ The Little Ice Age ’ where crops failed and plague wiped out tens of millions of people showing a clear correlation between solar activity and temperature on Earth . Likewise , there was also high solar activity during the Medieval Warm Period .\n\nSome scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today ’ s climate than carbon dioxide , and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America , Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity .\n\n“ The Sun in my opinion is the primary driver of climate change , ” he said . “ The Sun is the big giant gorilla in the climate system . ”\n\nYet the IPCC insists that solar activity does not account for levels of warming seen at the end of the 20th century . Over the last 35 years the Sun has shown a cooling trend . However global temperatures continue to increase . If the Sun 's energy is decreasing while the Earth is warming , then the Sun can not be the main control of the temperature .\n\nBob Ward , Policy and Communications Director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics said : “ We can measure directly with satellites how the energy of the Sun varies and it does not match changes in the Earth ’ s temperature .\n\n“ The most important and central piece of evidence is that computer models that simulate the Earth ’ s climate are unable to reproduce the rise in global temperature over the past century just through natural variability , including the Sun ’ s activity . ”\n\nProfessor Rowan Sutton , Director of Climate Research in the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science ( NCAS ) , added : “ Simulations of climate change over the last century are only consistent with the observed warming when they include the rapid increase in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities . ”\n\nPressure at the Poles\n\nA quick glance at satellite images from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre ( NSIDC ) going back to 1981 shows an undeniable downward trend in Arctic sea ice over the past 35 years .\n\nPredictions by some scientists that the Arctic would be entirely ice free by 2016 have proven too alarmist , but at the current rate Nasa forecasts that The Arctic Ocean will become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century .\n\nIn the 19th century explorers such as Sir John Franklin raced to find a route through the northwest passage , to avoid the lengthy journey around the Americas to reach the Pacific Ocean . But even in the summer the route was blocked by impenetrable ice .\n\nToday the ice is melting at such a dramatic rate that large shipping companies are considering expanding their routes to the top of the world .\n\n\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have also decreased in mass . Data from Nasa 's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( Grace ) satellites show Greenland lost around 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016 , while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons . The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade .\n\nIn August 12.5 billion of tons of ice melted in Greenland , allowing children to play in the Arctic sea , as temperatures rose to 71.6F ( 22C ) , 27F ( 15C ) higher than average for the summer .\n\nExtreme cases of ice melting typically occur once every 250 years , however the enormous loss of ice on August 1 was the second since 2012 . Currently the 2019 loss of Greenland ice sheet mass is lower than 2012 , but higher than the 1981-20 mean .\n\nGlaciers are also retreating almost everywhere around the world including in the Alps , Himalayas , Andes , Rockies , Alaska and Africa .\n\nThe melting ice has led to global sea level rise of around eight inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880 . It is projected to rise another one to four by 2100 .\n\n\nBy the end of the century , experts predict that storm surges and high tides could combine with sea level rise to cause flooding in many regions .\n\nThe oceans have absorbed much of the increased heat of recent years , with the top 2,300ft ( 700m ) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4F since 1969 . And because saltwater expands as it warms , the extra heat is exacerbating sea level rise .\n\nLosing ice cover is important for climate not just because of rising seas but because ice is very good at reflecting back sunlight , a phenomenon known as the albedo effect . Without it , more energy is absorbed from the Sun and climate warms further .\n\nThis positive feedback loop has played a major role in glacial advances and retreats in the past .\n\nThe warming of the Greenland ice sheet is also triggering another phenomenon which could speed up climate change - biological darkening .\n\nProfessor Martyn Tranter of Bristol University ’ s School of Geographical Sciences said : “ The darkening is caused by the numerous glacier algae that grow in this area which are pigmented deep purple to shield their vital elements from the intense ultraviolet radiation in sunlight .\n\n“ There are so many of these deep purple algae that they look as black as the soot from tunda fires . ”\n\nScientists at the University of Prague have calculated that algae darkening is responsible for up to 10 per cent of total ice sheet melt each summer because it dims the albedo effect . And as more algae grows , the greater will be the impact .\n\nThe ice sheets are also holding one final timebomb . Trapped beneath the permafrost is a huge amount of methane which is unable to travel upwards because of the frozen ground above . If the permafrost melts this powerful greenhouse gas could be released , with some estimates suggesting it could amplify global warming by five per cent .\n\nMethane is especially dangerous , as it can warm the earth 86 times as much as carbon dioxide over 20 years in the atmosphere . Methane can also raise the acidity of the water and kill off sea creatures as it breaks down . And the ground warms , microbes in the soil may also wake up and start emitting greenhouse gases .\n\nExperts claim melting permafrost has the potental to release 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide , more than 40 times as much CO2 as humans released into the atmosphere last year .\n\nOcean currents\n\nOne of the most influential natural phenomena affecting weather and climate are ocean currents and particularly the ongoing swing between the El Niño and La Niña systems .\n\nEl Niño , which is Spanish for ‘ the little boy ’ , was first coined in the 1880s by Peruvian fisherman who noticed that every few years the cold north-flowing current in which they fished would switch to a warm southerly flow . Because it tended to happen around Christmas time , it was named for the infant Jesus .\n\nIt wasn ’ t until the 1970s that satellites picked up the El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle ( ENSO ) on a global scale .\n\nUsually winds travel westwards over the Pacific picking up warm surface water which accumulates around Indonesia . This removal of warm water triggers deep water to move up to the surface bringing nutrients which attract fish . The accumulation of warm water in the west and colder water in the east sets in motion a convection pattern - known as the Walker Circulation - with air rising over Indonesia and sinking off the west coast of South America , bringing rainfall to the west and clear skies to the east , and conditions known as La Niña .\n\nHowever if the westerly winds are not strong enough , the warm water moves back , causing the Walker Circulation to break down as warm air begins to rise in the Central pacific , and El Niño occurs .\n\nGlobal temperature increases after an El Niño event and the following La Niña event causes it to fall . The warming temperatures around 2016 coincided with an El Niño event .\n\nDuring the slight cooling period between 1943–1976 , there were slightly more La Niña events than El Niño events , while the frequency is roughly equalised during the warming pause from 1998 .\n\nIn the warming period between 1976– 1998 there El Niño currents were more frequent . But because global warming itself is thought to trigger more El Niño events it is tricky to tease out whether ocean currents are having an impact on global warming or if global warming is leading to more events .\n\nDr Mike Rogerson , a Senior Lecturer and Convener of Geochemistry and Geobiology Group at Hull University said : `` There are lots of oscillations like this , but ENSO is the biggest .\n\n“ They change where the heat is , but not how much heat is in the system . When you compute the global mean , they often disappear . Otherwise , they add to the “ noise ” .\n\n“ The rising temperature we ’ ve seen in our lifetimes shows there is a massive forcing going on , and the best candidate by far is greenhouse gas forcing .\n\n“ All the other cycles , random changes , events and so on continue though . So even when the forcing is massive , you ’ ll still get some ups and downs relating to the complexity . ENSO is one such complexity . This is the “ noise ” which competes with the “ signal ” of climate change . ”\n\nA strange hiatus\n\nThe linear relationship between rising carbon dioxide levels and global warming appeared undeniable , until temperature increases began to slow down after 1998 and remained relatively stable for a period of 15 years , even though CO2 continued to rise .\n\nThe IPCC and the Met Office acknowledged that there had been a temperature ‘ pause ’ in the years after 1998 and experts started to question whether major ocean currents were having more influence on climate than models had previously allowed .\n\nWhen the IPCC published its Fifth Assessment Report in 2013 the panel concluded that more than 90 per cent of the extra heat trapped through global warming had been absorbed by the oceans .\n\nToday , the hiatus is still disputed as it is picked up in the Met Office ’ s compilation of global temperatures but not in the records compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and Nasa .\n\nDr Rogerson added : “ I don ’ t think it is a “ hiatus ” at all . It is more likely that some change in the Earth system happened in those years and the decade before , and the decade after as well as the warming .\n\n“ Imagine you are looking at your bank account , and over the years the amount in it slowly falls . You have a problem ! Of course , sometimes it might jump up again – each month , when you are paid . When you sell your car . When you make a killing on eBay . When you inherit from a relative . The number in your account has a “ hiatus ” .\n\n“ Does that mean you are living sustainably during that “ hiatus ” ? No . Is it surprisingly that the world continues , and affects you as time passes – even though you are poor at managing your money ? No , it isn ’ t . You need to change your habits , or face bankruptcy .\n\nDr Ward added : “ The difference is probably due to the way in which these different groups calculate a global average from the worldwide network of weather stations .\n\n“ For instance , a key uncertainty occurs in the polar regions where we do not have many stations . The Met Office largely ignores areas that have no records whereas NOAA and NASA makes assumptions about the rate of warming in those regions .\n\n“ In the end , even if the hiatus did exist it was only temporary and not particularly significant in the overall record . We know that global temperature varies from year to year depending on many natural factors , such as the occurrence of El Niño , but these variations are superimposed on the clear and undeniable warming trend caused by the rise in greenhouse gases . ”\n\nAdjustments and manipulations\nOne of the most devastating blows to the science of climate change came in 2009 when hackers downloaded thousands of emails and computer files from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) .\n\nContents of the emails suggested scientists had been hiding or manipulating data , preventing people accessing their figures and working to stop papers critical of their findings from being published .\n\nIn one particularly damning email , CRU director Phil Jones said he had used ‘ Mike ’ s Nature trick ’ to ‘ hide the decline ’ in temperatures in the second half of the 20th century .\n\nJust like Dr Mann ’ s ‘ hockey stick ’ graph he had cut off the tree-ring data just at the point where it stopped showing an upward trend and swapped in thermometer temperatures for recent decades , making them look much warmer .\n\nIn an interview with the BBC after the scandal broke , Dr Jones admitted there had been ‘ no statistically significant global warming since 1995. ’ Although reviews into Climategate found that the scientists had not acted unethically , Commons Science and Technology Committee member Graham Stringer wrote a minority report saying the inquiries had not been independent .\n\nThe IPCC was also not exempt from misleading the public . The panel was forced to retract a statement in its 2007 report saying all Himalayan glaciers could melt entirely by 2035 .\n\nIt later emerged that many of the alarming claims cited in IPCC reports were not based on science but press releases and unfounded reports made by climate activists . One claim , that global warming was threatening to destroy 40 per cent of the Amazon ’ s rainforest was eventually traced back to a leaflet distributed by a Brazilian environmental group , who were concerned with logging and man-made forest fires , not climate change .\n\nAn investigation into the conduct of the IPCC by the Interacademy Council warned in 2010 that the process of using validated scientific sources must be tightened up .\n\nThe figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed . A survey which claimed to have questioned 10,257 academics , was found to have winnowed down the sample to just 77 .\n\nA poll of 1854 members of the American Meteorological Society found the number who believe climate change to be man-made to be 52 per cent .\n\n“ The 97 per cent figure is derived from two pieces of pseudoscience that would have embarrassed a homeopath , ” said Viscount Ridley in his climate blog .\n\nClimate skeptics argue temperature records have been adjusted in recent years to make the past appear cooler and the present warmer , although the Carbon Brief showed that NOAA has actually made the past warmer , evening out the difference .\n\nSatellite data from Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS ) in California initially showed temperatures which largely flatlined from 1998 , but that data has since been adjusted to show a warming trend .\n\nThe difference between recorded temperatures and reported temperatures has been slowly rising in recent years .\n\nConfusion peaked in 2014 when surface temperature readings said the year was the hottest on record , while satellites maintained it was cooler than 1998 . A look at the figures showed the Met Office dataset ‘ HadCRUt ’ had been adjusted to show 1998 as cooler .\n\nAlthough it might appear scientists are ‘ cooking the books ’ , experts say the shifts are necessary to avoid biases from station relocations , instrument changes , the time of day and the heat island effect .\n\n“ These are done to ensure that temperature measurements can be compared over time , ” said Dr Ward .\n\n“ For instance , the time of day at which temperature is measured makes a big difference so many previous measurements which were recorded at different times of day have to be adjusted to ensure that they can be compared .\n\n“ When the measuring equipment gets old and need s replacing , it often requires re-calibration . What skeptics often ignore is the fact that the adjustments at a site can go either up or down . Linked to this is the claim that some sites record a warming because they have become urbanised . This is a legitimate concern but these sites are usually excluded from the temperature record as a result . ”", "label": [[148, 284, "Faulty Generalization"], [147, 284, "Intentional"], [1943, 2019, "Intentional"], [2758, 2779, "Intentional"], [2916, 3054, "Intentional"], [2758, 2780, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [5070, 5144, "Intentional"], [6091, 6230, "Intentional"], [6232, 6344, "Faulty Generalization"], [8075, 8104, "Ad Hominem"], [9140, 9179, "Faulty Generalization"], [9968, 10026, "Faulty Generalization"], [11358, 11429, "Intentional"], [14564, 14622, "Faulty Generalization"], [14849, 14958, "Faulty Generalization"], [26489, 26657, "Ad Hominem"], [26737, 26786, "Intentional"], [27165, 27219, "Intentional"], [28280, 28499, "Intentional"], [28511, 28562, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [28823, 28931, "Intentional"], [29239, 29350, "Intentional"], [18393, 18404, "Intentional"], [28495, 28497, "Intentional"], [7750, 7894, "Intentional"], [28236, 28641, "Ad Populum"], [5046, 5058, "Equivocation"], [14519, 14958, "False Causality"], [740, 844, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/10/15/climate-change-fake-news-global-threat-science/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/telegraph-article-misleads-with-false-balance-mixing-in-unsupported-and-inaccurate-claims-sarah-knapton/"}

{"id": 747, "data": "A harrowing scenario analysis of how human civilization might collapse in coming decades due to climate change has been endorsed by a former Australian defense chief and senior royal navy commander .\n\nThe analysis , published by the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration , a think-tank in Melbourne , Australia , describes climate change as “ a near- to mid-term existential threat to human civilization ” and sets out a plausible scenario of where business-as-usual could lead over the next 30 years .\n\nThe paper argues that the potentially “ extremely serious outcomes ” of climate-related security threats are often far more probable than conventionally assumed , but almost impossible to quantify because they “ fall outside the human experience of the last thousand years . ”\n\nOn our current trajectory , the report warns , “ planetary and human systems [ are ] reaching a ‘ point of no return ’ by mid-century , in which the prospect of a largely uninhabitable Earth leads to the breakdown of nations and the international order . ”\n\nThe only way to avoid the risks of this scenario is what the report describes as “ akin in scale to the World War II emergency mobilization ” —but this time focused on rapidly building out a zero-emissions industrial system to set in train the restoration of a safe climate .\n\nThe scenario warns that our current trajectory will likely lock in at least 3 degrees Celsius ( C ) of global heating , which in turn could trigger further amplifying feedbacks unleashing further warming . This would drive the accelerating collapse of key ecosystems “ including coral reef systems , the Amazon rainforest and in the Arctic . ”\n\nThe results would be devastating . Some one billion people would be forced to attempt to relocate from unlivable conditions , and two billion would face scarcity of water supplies . Agriculture would collapse in the sub-tropics , and food production would suffer dramatically worldwide . The internal cohesion of nation-states like the US and China would unravel .\n\n“ Even for 2°C of warming , more than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high-end scenarios , the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model with a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end , ” the report notes .\n\nThe new policy briefing is written by David Spratt , Breakthrough ’ s research director and Ian Dunlop , a former senior executive of Royal Dutch Shell who previously chaired the Australian Coal Association .\n\nIn the briefing ’ s foreword , retired Admiral Chris Barrie—Chief of the Australian Defence Force from 1998 to 2002 and former Deputy Chief of the Australian Navy—commends the paper for laying “ bare the unvarnished truth about the desperate situation humans , and our planet , are in , painting a disturbing picture of the real possibility that human life on Earth may be on the way to extinction , in the most horrible way . ”\n\nBarrie now works for the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University , Canberra .\n\nSpratt told Motherboard that a key reason the risks are not understood is that “ much knowledge produced for policymakers is too conservative . Because the risks are now existential , a new approach to climate and security risk assessment is required using scenario analysis . ”\n\nLast October , Motherboard reported on scientific evidence that the UN ’ s summary report for government policymakers on climate change—whose findings were widely recognized as “ devastating ” —were in fact too optimistic .\n\nWhile the Breakthrough scenario sets out some of the more ‘ high end ’ risk possibilities , it is often not possible to meaningfully quantify their probabilities . As a result , the authors emphasize that conventional risk approaches tend to downplay worst-case scenarios despite their plausibility .\n\nSpratt and Dunlop ’ s 2050 scenario illustrates how easy it could be to end up in an accelerating runaway climate scenario which would lead to a largely uninhabitable planet within just a few decades .\n\n“ A high-end 2050 scenario finds a world in social breakdown and outright chaos , ” said Spratt . “ But a short window of opportunity exists for an emergency , global mobilization of resources , in which the logistical and planning experiences of the national security sector could play a valuable role . ”", "label": [[797, 1053, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2697, 2932, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [0, 29, "Intentional"], [37, 110, "Faulty Generalization"], [358, 418, "Faulty Generalization"], [846, 1051, "Intentional"], [1159, 1194, "Intentional"], [1713, 2041, "Faulty Generalization"], [2151, 2270, "Logical Fallacy"], [2850, 2902, "Faulty Generalization"], [4044, 4121, "Faulty Generalization"], [4044, 4122, "Intentional"], [2850, 2901, "Intentional"], [1712, 2040, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.iflscience.com/environment/new-report-warns-high-likelihood-of-human-civilization-coming-to-an-end-within-30-years/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/iflscience-story-on-speculative-report-provides-little-scientific-context-james-felton/"}
{"id": 748, "data": "Bill Shorten and his allies , the Greens economic vandals , believe climate change is a moral issue . So is telling the truth .\n\nWith his elite private school education , the Oppo­s­i­tion Leader would have learned about the Roman Warming , the Dark Ages , the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age . These took place before industrialisation and were all driven by changes in the sun . He would have learned that ­natural warm times , like now , bring great prosperity , increased longevity and less disease , whereas Jack Frost brings death , depopulation and economic stresses .\n\nIn biology , the Labor leader would have learned of Darwinism and environmental adapta­tion of species . Humans live on ice and in the hills , valleys , tropics and des­erts , at altitude and on coastal plains . Like countless other organ­isms , we move and adapt when the environment changes . Species thrive when it is warm .\n\nFrom his education at a relig­ious school , he would have learned about the apostle Thomas . One of the strengths of our Western civilisation is doubt and scepticism . Surely Shorten does not believe the catastrophism promoted by green activists and self-interested alleged experts at the expense of the nation . If he does , he is unelectable .\n\nIf he is knowingly promoting a falsehood , he is unelectable . Critical thinking was fundamental to our culture and should be embraced in policy formulation . In school science , Shorten would have learned carbon dioxide is the food of life and without this natural gas , which occurs in space and all planets , there would be no life .\n\nHe also would understand from his maths lessons that when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent , then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate .\n\nA quick search would show him that whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life , the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present . If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere , all life dies .\n\nShorten should know that for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing , with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact , super-volcano or a supernova explosion .\n\nHe should know that climate always changes and that the planet would be in serious trouble if it did not . There are cycles of air , water , rocks and continents . There are measurable cycles with the sun , Earth ’ s orbit , oceans and moon that drive climate change , especially if cycles coincide . It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past .\n\nDespite hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure during the past few decades , it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming . Yet wind and solar industrial complexes pepper the landscape allegedly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .\n\nThey run on subsidies , not the wind or the sun . Wind and solar are transfering money from the poor to the rich , not saving the environment . These subsidies , paid by the long-suffering consumer and employer , add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine .\n\nThe amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives . The amount of carbon dioxide released during construction and maintenance is far more than is saved . Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area , slice and dice birds and bats , kill insects that are bird food , create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them , leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape .\n\nUnion superannuation funds have invested massively in renewable energy . Labor ’ s promise of 50 per cent renewables will cost electricity consumers hundreds of billions but will benefit the unions .\n\nAs soon as renewables were introduced into the grid , electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable . Increased elec­tric­ity costs have created unemployment , and many pensioners and the poor can not afford electricity . An increase in renewables will make matters worse .\n\nDoes Shorten ’ s energy policy consider those who lose jobs and have the power cut off in his race to achieve 50 per cent renewables to fill the pockets of Labor union mates ? And what about the scams siphoning off tens of billions that slosh around the world as carbon credits , carbon trading and renewable energy certificates ? Rather than take this money from the poor via higher electricity prices , it would be better spent at home .\n\nTo smugly claim that valid questions about energy costs are dumb or deceitful is a loud warning bell . Shorten refuses to tell us how he will spend our money or to give any detail on energy ­systems that are proven failures . It is our money and , if he will not give us the financial details , we should be very scared of his shiftiness . I have never written a blank cheque for a used car .

{"id": 749, "data": "The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax .\n\nOf course , no one will admit it , but that is exactly what has happened .\n\nA new scientific study shows has revealed the following :\n\nCurrent CO2 levels of 410 parts per million ( ppm ) were last seen on Earth three million years ago , according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth ’ s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research ( PIK ) and published in Science Advances .\n\nYes , you read that correctly , three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today , but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…\n\nThree million years ago , we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts ; we weren ’ t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories ; there was no Industrial Age , no plastic , no air conditioning , no electricity , no lumber mills , no consumerism , no aerosols .\n\nIn fact , three million years ago , there were probably no human beings on Earth , at least not human in the way we use that term today . And yet…\n\nCO2 levels were the same then as they are now…\n\nHmmm… ?\n\nBut I thought humans warmed the planet ? That ’ s the hustle we ’ ve been sold for three decades now — you know , that WE are the problem .\n\nWe have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit . Oh , no , that could never be it — so stop saying that could be , you Denier .\n\nWell , what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age .\n\nShut up , Denier .\n\nAnd yet…\n\nAccording to the study , scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “ there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica , and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone . ”\n\nHow is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer ?\n\nIt gets worse :\n\nTemperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally , at least double that at the poles , and sea levels were some 20 meters ( 65 feet ) higher .\n\nHow is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills ?\n\nNaturally , even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming , ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following :\n\nThe good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly , and mile-thick ice sheets melt even more slowly . So the temperature rise will take several decades , and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years .\n\nBut-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years !\n\nAnd then ThinkProgress drops this anti-science stink bomb :\n\nThat means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet .\n\nBecause , because , because Orange Man Bad :\n\nEven worse , the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels , sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades .\n\nNo , actually , what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth ’ s naturally occurring climate cycles . Even the worst of the worst , even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that , at best , we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees , which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees , as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines .", "label": [[586, 673, "Intentional"], [1429, 1554, "Intentional"], [3472, 3555, "Intentional"], [3666, 3811, "False Dilemma"], [268, 368, "Intentional"], [1070, 1253, "False Dilemma"], [4, 12, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [554, 1058, "False Causality"], [554, 1058, "Logical Fallacy"], [2098, 2361, "Logical Fallacy"], [3106, 3120, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3106, 3120, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3441, 3555, "Logical Fallacy"], [3563, 3610, "Ad Hominem"], [3666, 3811, "Logical Fallacy"], [3859, 3908, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [344, 367, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3106, 3120, "Ad Hominem"], [3859, 3877, "Ad Hominem"]], "source_url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/09/nolte-scientists-prove-man-made-global-warming-is-a-hoax/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-baselessly-claims-a-study-of-past-climate-invalidates-human-caused-climate-change-john-nolte/"}
{"id": 753, "data": "The Earth is not warming . The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise . Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet .\n\nThose are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science , Space and Technology Committee yesterday . The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming .\n\nA leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements .\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation . But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science . Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy , president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S . Global Change Research Program .\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R-CA ) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee , which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records .\n\n`` I 'm a little bit disturbed by , No . 1 , over and over again , I hear , 'Do n't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing , ' '' he said . `` That 's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting , when basically we should all be open to different points of view . ''\n\nRep. Lamar Smith ( R-TX ) , chairman of the committee , entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change , a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies . The piece was written by Fred Singer , who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute in Chicago , Illinois , which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science .\n\n`` To solve climate change challenges , we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist , '' Smith said in his opening remarks . `` Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change . ''\n\nAt one point , Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels . When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use , Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station , near San Francisco , and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world . Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO2 levels or temperatures , both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased .\n\n`` The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago , '' Duffy told Smith in response to the charts .\n\n`` Is this chart inaccurate , then ? '' Smith asked .\n\n`` It 's accurate , but it does n't represent what 's happening globally ; it represents what 's happening in San Francisco , '' Duffy said .\n\nRep. Mo Brooks ( R-AL ) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise , pointing out that land subsidence plays a role , as well as human activity .\n\nBrooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise , which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers . He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year , and that contributes to sea-level rise . He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world 's major rivers , including the Mississippi , the Amazon and the Nile , is contributing to sea-level rise .\n\n`` Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas , that forces the sea levels to rise , because now you have less space in those oceans , because the bottom is moving up , '' Brooks said .\n\nDuffy responded : `` I 'm pretty sure that on human time scales , those are minuscule effects . ''\n\nBrooks added that Antarctic ice is growing . That was true a few years ago , and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting .\n\n`` We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage , '' Duffy said .\n\n`` I 'm sorry , but I do n't know where you 're getting your information , but the data I have seen suggests — `` Brooks said .\n\nDuffy answered : `` The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . ''\n\n`` Well , I 've got a NASA base in my district , and apparently , they 're telling you one thing and me a different thing , '' Brooks said . `` But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet , particularly that above land , is increasing , not decreasing . Now , you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic . ''\n\nEarlier this year , NASA researchers determined that Antarctica 's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade . More broadly , sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year . Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based , meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts .\n\nRep. Bill Posey ( R-FL ) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling , a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme . Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet .\n\nPosey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed . Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter . Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground , releasing the carbon into the atmosphere , Duffy said .\n\nPosey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people .\n\n`` What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature ? '' Posey asked .\n\n`` Look , if you want to characterize a temperature above today 's temperature as normal , you 're free to do that , but that does n't mean that 's a planet we want to live on , '' Duffy said .\n\n`` I do n't want to get philosophical ; I 'm trying to stay on science here , '' Posey said .\n\n`` I 'm not getting philosophical ; I 'm getting extremely practical , '' Duffy said . `` I 'm being extremely practical — if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees , we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise , and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist . ''\n\nPosey responded : `` I do n't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer ; I think what 's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what , and getting to that is , I think , where we 're trying to go with this committee .

{"id": 754, "data": "It 's the final call , say scientists , in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures .\n\nTheir dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C says the world is now completely off track , heading instead towards 3C .\n\nKeeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean `` rapid , far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society '' .\n\nIt will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open .\n\nAfter three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C .\n\nWhat could be wiped out by temperature rise\nWhat is climate change ?\nThe critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards .\n\nDespite the inevitable compromises , there are some key messages that come through loud and clear .\n\n`` The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees . It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways , '' said Prof Jim Skea , who co-chairs the IPCC .\n\n`` The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems , changes to the way we manage land , changes to the way we move around with transportation . ''\n\nWhat 's one big takeaway ?\n`` Scientists might want to write in capital letters , 'ACT NOW , IDIOTS , ' but they need to say that with facts and numbers , '' said Kaisa Kosonen , of Greenpeace , who was an observer at the negotiations . `` And they have . ''\n\nThe researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever , caused by humans . We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century , then the changes we would experience would be manageable .\n\nNot any more . This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet 's liveability . And the 1.5C temperature `` guard rail '' could be exceeded in just 12 years , in 2030 .\n\nWe can stay below it - but it will require urgent , large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year , about 2.5 % of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the value of all goods and services produced , for two decades .\n\nEven then , we will still need machines , trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever .\n\nWhat can I do ?\nThe report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems :\n\nenergy • land use • cities • industry\nBut it adds that the world can not meet its target without changes by individuals , urging people to :\n\nbuy less meat , milk , cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away • drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances • take trains and buses instead of planes • use videoconferencing instead of business travel • use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer • insulate homes • demand low carbon in every consumer product\nLifestyle changes can make a big difference , said Dr Debra Roberts , the IPCC 's other co-chair .\n\n`` That 's a very empowering message for the individual , '' she said . `` This is not about remote science ; it is about where we live and work , and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change , because everyone is going to have to be involved . ''\n\n`` You might say you do n't have control over land use , but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use .\n\n`` We can choose the way we move in cities and if we do n't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport . ''\n\nFive steps to 1.5\nGlobal emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030\nRenewables are estimated to provide up to 85 % of global electricity by 2050\nCoal is expected to reduce to close to zero\nUp to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops ( a bit less than the size of Australia )\nGlobal net zero emissions by 2050\n\nHow much will all this cost ?\nIt wo n't come cheap . The report says to limit warming to 1.5C , will involve `` annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $ 2.4 trillion '' between 2016 and 2035 .\n\nExperts believe this number needs to be put in context .\n\n`` There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up , '' said Dr Stephen Cornelius , a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF . He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century .\n\n`` The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you do n't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two . ''\n\nFive things we have learned from the report\nFast fashion is harming the planet , MPs say\nVietnam 's children and the fear of climate change\n\nWhat happens if we do n't act ?\nThe researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C , we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world .\n\nYou can kiss coral reefs goodbye , as the report says they would be essentially 100 % wiped out at two degrees of warming .\n\nGlobal sea-level will rise about 10cm ( 4in ) more if we let warming go to 2C . That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding .\n\nThere are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity , and the ability to grow crops such as rice , maize and wheat .\n\n`` We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming , '' said Kaisa Kosonen , from Greenpeace . `` Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate ; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying ; and the summer we 've just experienced - basically , the whole world was on fire . ''\n\nIs this plan at all feasible ?\nAnalysis by David Shukman , BBC science editor\n\nThe countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated . Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close .\n\nBy the same token , the report 's `` pathways '' for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions can not be delayed :\n\na shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century\ncoal phased out far sooner than previously suggested\nvast tracts of land given over to forests\nIt 's mind-bending stuff and some will say it 's hopelessly unrealistic , a climate scientists ' fantasy . So is any of it plausible ? On the one hand , the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it . On the other , wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets .\n\nUltimately , politicians will face a difficult choice : persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong .\n\nIs all this about saving small island states ?\nThe idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states , which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees .\n\nBut over the three years that the report was in preparation , more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific .\n\n`` If you save a small island country , then you save the world , '' said Dr Amjad Abdulla , an IPCC author , from the Maldives . `` Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune . It 's about morality - it 's about humanity . ''\n\nHow long have we got ?\nNot long at all . But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders . The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road . If the nations of the world do n't act soon , they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road .\n\n`` They really need to start work immediately . The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030 , it is not good enough . It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C , '' said Prof Jim Skea .\n\n`` If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately , then 1.5C stays within reach - that 's the nature of the choice they face . ''\n\nCampaigners and environmentalists , who have welcomed the report , say there is simply no time left for debate .\n\n`` This is the moment where we need to decide '' said Kaisa Kosonen . `` We want to move to clean energy , sustainable lifestyles . We want to protect our forests and species . This is the moment that we will remember ; this is the year when the turning point happened .

Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years .\n\n“ This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming , including more heatwaves and hot summers , greater sea level rise , and , for many parts of the world , worse droughts and rainfall extremes , ” Andrew King , a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne , said in a statement .\n\nGlobal net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach “ net zero ” around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C .\n\nLowering emissions to this degree , while technically possible , would require widespread changes in energy , industry , buildings , transportation and cities , the report says .\n\n“ The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal , ” added King .\n\nThe report makes it clear that climate change is already happening – and what comes next could be even worse , unless urgent international political action is taken .\n\nConsequences of past inaction\n“ One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather , rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice , among other changes , ” said Panmao Zhai , co-chair of IPCC Working Group I .\n\nEven if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C , the impacts will be widespread and significant .\n\nTemperatures during summer heatwaves , such as those just experienced across Europe this summer , can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report .\n\nMore frequent or intense droughts , such as the one that nearly ran the taps dry in Cape Town , South Africa , as well as more frequent extreme rainfall events such as hurricanes Harvey and Florence in the United States , are also pointed to as expectations as we reach the warming threshold .\n\nCoral reefs will also be drastically affected , with between 70 and 90 % expected to die off , including Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef .\n\nCountries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off , the report said , “ projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase . ”\n\nThe report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters .\n\n“ Every extra bit of warming matters , especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes , such as the loss of some ecosystems , ” said Hans-Otto Pörtner , Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II .\n\nThe report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase , compared to the 2 degrees C increase :\n\nGlobal sea levels would rise 10 cm lower by 2100 .\nThe likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century , instead of at least once per decade .\nCoral reefs would decline by 70 % to 90 % instead of being almost completely wiped out .\n\n’ Possible with the laws of chemistry and physics ’\nMonday ’ s report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement . In the Paris accord , 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures “ well below ” 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C .\n\nThe United States was initially in the agreement , but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later , claiming it was unfair to the country .\n\nTo limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is “ possible within the laws of chemistry and physics , ” said Jim Skea , co-chair of IPCC Working Group III . “ But doing so would require unprecedented changes . ”\n\n“ International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts , as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation , ” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick , a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales . “ The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts . ”\n\nOne key issue will be negative emissions , large scale carbon-scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution .\n\nAccording to the report , there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere : increasing natural processes that already do this , and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies .\n\nHowever , all methods “ are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others , as they have not been tested at scale , ” the report warned .\n\nThey will also require considerable political engagement globally , as will reducing the amount of carbon being emitted . Despite the report ’ s dire warnings , there is no indication such cooperation will be doable , particularly given the Trump administration ’ s stance on this issue .\n\n“ Today the world ’ s leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear – that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy , ” former US Vice President Al Gore said .\n\n“ Unfortunately , the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past . The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses , states , cities and citizens leading the transformation . ”", "label": [[4597, 4625, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [6420, 6463, "Ad Hominem"], [4597, 4625, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1939, 1974, "Faulty Generalization"], [3033, 3075, "Equivocation"], [6452, 6463, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/07/world/climate-change-new-ipcc-report-wxc/index.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/cnn-accurately-covers-latest-ipcc-report-brandon-miller/"}
{"id": 759, "data": "NASA posted this video to YouTube with this description , “ Arctic sea ice has not only been shrinking in surface area in recent years , it ’ s becoming younger and thinner as well . In this animation , where the ice cover almost looks gelatinous as it pulses through the seasons , cryospheric scientist Dr. Walt Meier of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center describes how the sea ice has undergone fundamental changes during the era of satellite measurements . ”\n\n2017 was once again one of the hottest years on record , ranked as the second-warmest by NASA and third-warmest by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n\nThe findings “ continue the planet ’ s long-term warming trend , ” according to NASA . A trend that is driven predominately by human activity through carbon dioxide emissions .\n\nTemperature records for the planet , monitored independently by both agencies , go back to 1880 . The announcement came at a joint press conference on Thursday in Washington .\n\nThe hottest year on record remains 2016 , while 2015 ranks second according to NOAA and third by NASA , which means the top three years have been the most recent three .\n\nThough 2017 was slightly cooler on average compared to 2016. the trend towards a warmer planet has never been clearer .\n\nThe six hottest years have all occurred since 2010 and 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001 .\n\nAccording to NASA , the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C ( 1.62˚F ) above the 20th century average . This puts us well over halfway to the ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5˚ C ( 2.7˚F ) set in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nScientists believe if that if we are to avoid exceeding that limit , carbon emissions would need to be significantly reduced starting immediately .\n\nLa Niña not enough to cool us down\nThe slight downturn in temperatures this year can be partially explained by the presence of La Niña , which began in late 2016 and lasted into 2017 and returned late in the year — whereas a robust El Niño was in place during portions of 2015 and 2016 .\n\nEl Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean — which tends to drive up global temperatures . Therefore years containing El Niños tend to be warmer globally than other years .\n\nLa Niñas , on the other hand , feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific , and tend to cool the planet down .\n\nThe fact that 2017 was the second- or third-warmest year on record , despite the presence of a cooling La Niña , speaks to the overall warming trend the Earth is experiencing thanks to overall global warming .\n\nAccording to NASA , if “ the effects of the recent El Niño and La Niña patterns were statistically removed from the record , 2017 would have been the warmest year on record . ”\n\nGlobal climate highlights of 2017\nSea ice continued its declining trend , both in the Arctic and Antarctic . The Antarctic , which was trending at record high levels just a few years ago , reached a record low during 2017 , with ice covering 154,000 fewer square miles than the previous record low set in 1986 .\n\nIn the Arctic , sea ice extent was the second-lowest since records began in 1979 , behind only 2016 , though record low sea ice was observed during the winter months of January-March .\n\nTemperatures significantly warmer than normal around the planet did not mean there was a lack of snow , however . In the northern hemisphere , the average snow cover extent was the largest since 1985 and the eighth largest since records began in 1968 , according to Rutgers University ’ s Global Snow Lab .\n\n2017 also featured a number of extreme weather events , most notably the record number of major hurricanes impacting the US and Caribbean , which led to the costliest year for weather disasters in US history .", "label": [[3696, 3777, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://via.hypothes.is/https://fox2now.com/news/nasa-releases-time-lapse-of-the-disappearing-arctic-polar-ice-cap/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/popular-story-fox2news-accurately-describes-2017-global-temperature-sea-ice-extent-cnn/"}
{"id": 760, "data": "The world ’ s oceans have been soaking up far more excess heat in recent decades than scientists realized , suggesting that Earth could be set to warm even faster than predicted in the years ahead , according to new research published Wednesday .\n\nOver the past quarter-century , Earth ’ s oceans have retained 60 percent more heat each year than scientists previously had thought , said Laure Resplandy , a geoscientist at Princeton University who led the startling study published Wednesday in the journal Nature . The difference represents an enormous amount of additional energy , originating from the sun and trapped by Earth ’ s atmosphere — the yearly amount representing more than eight times the world ’ s annual energy consumption .\n\nIn the scientific realm , the new findings help resolve long-running doubts about the rate of the warming of the oceans before 2007 , when reliable measurements from devices called “ Argo floats ” were put to use worldwide . Before that , differing types of temperature records — and an overall lack of them — contributed to murkiness about how quickly the oceans were heating up .\n\nThe higher-than-expected amount of heat in the oceans means more heat is being retained within Earth ’ s climate system each year , rather than escaping into space . In essence , more heat in the oceans signals that global warming is more advanced than scientists thought .\n\n“ We thought that we got away with not a lot of warming in both the ocean and the atmosphere for the amount of CO2 that we emitted , ” said Resplandy , who published the work with experts from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and several other institutions in the United States , China , France and Germany . “ But we were wrong . The planet warmed more than we thought . It was hidden from us just because we didn ’ t sample it right . But it was there . It was in the ocean already . ”\n\nWednesday ’ s study also could have important policy implications . If ocean temperatures are rising more rapidly than previously calculated , that could leave nations even less time to dramatically cut the world ’ s emissions of carbon dioxide , in the hope of limiting global warming to the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) above preindustrial levels by the end of this century .\n\nThe world already has warmed one degree Celsius ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) since the late 19th century . Scientists backed by the United Nations reported this month that with warming projected to steadily increase , the world faces a daunting challenge in trying to limit that warming to only another half-degree Celsius . The group found that it would take “ unprecedented ” action by leaders across the globe over the coming decade to even have a shot at that goal .\n\nMeanwhile , the Trump administration has continued to roll back regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from vehicles , coal plants and other sources and has said it intends to withdraw from the Paris climate accord . In one instance , the administration relied on an assumption that the planet will warm a disastrous seven degrees Fahrenheit , or about four degrees Celsius , by the end of the century in arguing that a proposal to ease vehicle fuel-efficiency standards would have only minor climate impacts .\n\nThe new research underscores the potential consequences of global inaction . Rapidly warming oceans mean that seas will rise faster and that more heat will be delivered to critical locations that already are facing the effects of a warming climate , such as coral reefs in the tropics and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica .\n\n“ In case the larger estimate of ocean heat uptake turns out to be true , adaptation to — and mitigation of — our changing climate would become more urgent , ” said Pieter Tans , who is the leader of the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and was not involved in the study .\n\nThe oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess energy trapped within the world ’ s atmosphere .\n\nThe new research does not measure the ocean ’ s temperature directly . Rather , it measures the volume of gases , specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide , that have escaped the ocean in recent decades and headed into the atmosphere as it heats up . The method offered scientists a reliable indicator of ocean temperature change because it reflects a fundamental behavior of a liquid when heated .\n\n“ When the ocean warms , it loses some gas to the atmosphere , ” Resplandy said . “ That ’ s an analogy that I make all the time : If you leave your Coke in the sun , it will lose the gas . ”\n\nThis approach allowed researchers to recheck the contested history of ocean temperatures in a different and novel way . In doing so , they came up with a higher number for how much warming the oceans have experienced over time .\n\n“ I feel like this is a triumph of Earth-system science . That we could get confirmation from atmospheric gases of ocean heat content is extraordinary , ” said Joellen Russell , a professor and oceanographer at the University of Arizona . “ You ’ ve got the A team here on this paper . ”\n\nBut Russell said the findings are hardly as uplifting .\n\nThe report “ does have implications for climate sensitivity , meaning , how warm does a certain amount of CO2 make us ? ” Russell said , adding that the world could have a smaller “ carbon budget ” than once thought . That budget refers to the amount of carbon dioxide humans can emit while still being able to keep warming below dangerous levels .\n\nThe scientists calculated that because of the increased heat already stored in the ocean , the maximum emissions that the world can produce while still avoiding a warming of two degrees Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) would have to be reduced by 25 percent . That represents a very significant shrinkage of an already very narrow carbon “ budget . ”\n\nThe U.N. panel of climate scientists said recently that global carbon emissions must be cut in half by 2030 if the world hopes to remain beneath 1.5 Celsius of warming . But Resplandy said that the evidence of faster-warming oceans “ shifts the probability , making it harder to stay below the 1.5-degree temperature target . ''\n\nUnderstanding what is happening with Earth ’ s oceans is critical , because they , far more than the atmosphere , are the mirror of ongoing climate change .\n\nAccording to a major climate report released last year by the U.S. government , the world ’ s oceans have absorbed about 93 percent of the excess heat caused by greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century . Scientists have found that ocean heat has increased at all depths since the 1960s , while surface waters also have warmed . The federal climate report projected a global increase in average sea surface temperatures of as much as nearly five degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions continue unabated , with even higher levels of warming in some U.S. coastal regions .\n\nThe world ’ s oceans also absorb more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted annually from human activities — an effect making them more acidic and threatening fragile ecosystems , federal researchers say . “ The rate of acidification is unparalleled in at least the past 66 million years , ” the government climate report stated .\n\nPaul Durack , a research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , said Wednesday ’ s study offers “ a really interesting new insight ” and is “ quite alarming . ”\n\nThe warming found in the study is “ more than twice the rates of long-term warming estimates from the 1960s and ’ 70s to the present , ” Durack said , adding that if these rates are validated by further studies , “ it means the rate of warming and the sensitivity of the Earth ’ s system to greenhouse gases is at the upper end. ” He said that if scientists have underestimated the amount of heat taken up by the oceans , “ it will mean we need to go back to the drawing board ” on the aggressiveness of mitigation actions the world needs to take promptly to limit future warming .\n\nBeyond the long-term implications of warmer oceans , Russell added that in the short term , even small changes in ocean temperatures can affect weather in specific places . For instance , scientists have said warmer oceans off the coast of New England have contributed to more-intense winter storms .\n\n“ We ’ re only just now discovering how important ocean warming is to our daily lives , to our daily weather , ” she said .", "label": [[3008, 3301, "Intentional"], [5133, 5181, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/31/startling-new-research-finds-large-buildup-heat-oceans-suggesting-faster-rate-global-warming/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-accurately-describes-ocean-warming-study-with-potential-implications-for-future-carbon-budget-chris-mooney-brady-dennis/"}
{"id": 761, "data": "Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change , according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system ’ s impact on the environment . In western countries , beef consumption needs to fall by 90 % and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses .\n\nThe research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet ’ s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades .\n\nFood production already causes great damage to the environment , via greenhouse gases from livestock , deforestation and water shortages from farming , and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution . But without action , its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples , enabling more people to eat meat-rich western diets .\n\nThis trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live , the new research indicates . “ It is pretty shocking , ” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford , who led the research team . “ We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system . If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat , then we better not do that . ”\n\n“ Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible , but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food , ” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany , who was part of the research team . “ Greening the food sector or eating up our planet : this is what is on the menu today . ”\n\nThe new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world ’ s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C , beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought , floods and extreme heat . The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction .\n\nThe new research , published in the journal Nature , is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment . It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis .\n\n“ There is no magic bullet , ” said Springmann . “ But dietary and technological change [ on farms ] are the two essential things , and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste. ” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table .\n\nThe researchers found a global shift to a “ flexitarian ” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C , let alone 1.5C . This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75 % less beef , 90 % less pork and half the number of eggs , while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds . This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts .\n\nIn rich nations , the dietary changes required are ever more stark . UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90 % and milk by 60 % while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times . However , the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy .\n\nReducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education , taxes , subsidies for plant-based foods and changes to school and workplace menus , the scientists said .\n\nTo halt deforestation , water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser , profound changes in farming practices are needed . These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations , more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers .\n\n“ I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options , ” Springmann said . “ We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible . ”\n\nAll the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world , said Springmann . In the Netherlands and Israel , fertilisers and water are being better used , while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities .\n\nBut a global change is needed , he said : “ I think we can do it , but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework . People can make a personal difference by changing their diet , but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important . Do not let politicians off the hook . ”\n\nProf Tim Benton at the University of Leeds , who was not part of the research team , said : “ Ultimately , we live on a finite planet , with finite resources . It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want , allowing us to overeat and throw food away. ” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “ undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet ” .\n\nProf Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen , who was also not part of the research team , said : “ We know food choices are very personal , and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage , but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future . The fact that it will also make us healthier makes it a no-brainer . ”", "label": [[4651, 4688, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [5143, 5185, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [375, 385, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [375, 385, "Intentional"], [890, 991, "Faulty Generalization"], [54, 78, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-accurately-describes-study-on-environmental-impacts-of-our-food-system-damian-carrington/"}
{"id": 765, "data": "Climate policy is underpinned by two fallacies . The first is that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming . The second is that future climate can be predicted from computer models .\n\nIt has yet to be shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive climate change . More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds , back-radiation and the sun were trivial .\n\nClimate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic and that a temporary terrestrial vertebrate on an evolving planet can change major planetary and extraterrestrial systems .\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nOverseas medicos on fly-in mission\nRACHEL BAXENDALE\nUnless the past is understood , climate projections can be only highly speculative . Even in our own lifetimes , there is no relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide emissions by ­humans , yet there is a very close relationship between solar activity and temperature .\n\nSince the beginning of time , water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate .\n\nCarbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere . We are expected to believe that emission of traces of a trace gas into the atmosphere is a major planetary driving force . If the atmosphere comprised 85,000 molecules , the total carbon dioxide emissions added annually would be 33 molecules , of which only one molecule would be from human emissions and the other 32 from natural emissions . Do we really believe that one bellowing fan in a crowd of 85,000 at the MCG can completely change the course of a game ?\n\nREAD MORE : Earth ‘ 2 degrees from hothouse ’\nFor the past 4567 million years , the sun and the Earth ’ s orbit have driven climate change cycles . In the past , the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now , yet there were ice ages .\n\nWe currently live in an interglacial during an ice age with alternating cycles of glaciations and interglacials . The current interglacial reached a peak about 5000 years ago . Since then , the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale and no amount of hot air , agreements , taxes , environmental wailing or legislation can change the fact that the Earth ’ s orbit is slowly taking us farther from the sun .\n\nJust 1.25 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-ocean system has been released by ­humans in the past 250 years . The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants , marine life , oceans and sediments . If human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming , why have there been slight warmings and coolings since the Industrial Revolution ? Why is it that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming yet natural emissions do not ?\n\nCarbon dioxide is plant food . Horticulturalists pump warm carbon dioxide into glasshouses to stimulate growth . Over the past 30 years , planet Earth has greened due to a slight increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide .\n\nWithout carbon dioxide , there would be no complex life on earth . It is neither pollution nor a poison , and in the past the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has varied enormously .\n\nWhen the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was low , plants struggled . When it was high , there was an expansion and increasing diversity of vegetation .\n\nIn addition , when it was warm , life expanded , whereas when it was cold , life contracted . Over historical times , when it was cold there was human depopulation . When it was warm , economies thrived .\n\nBiological , geological and planetary systems are extremely robust . Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres , super volcanoes filling the atmosphere with dust , asteroid impacts , mass extinctions , ice ages and global warming . For most of time , Earth has been a warm , wet volcanic planet with no polar ice .\n\nAustralia has uranium , coal and gas for generations . Fracking for tight gas and oil could further extend energy resources . We are the envy of the world . Australia once had cheap , reliable electricity and the states competed to provide cheap , long-term , reliable energy to attract industry .\n\nIllustration : Sturt Krygsman .\nIllustration : Sturt Krygsman .\nNow the states rely on the weather and compete to reach the bottom . South Australia is winning : it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity . When South Australians buy electricity at $ 14,200/MWh , they are paying the equivalent of $ 400 a litre for petrol .\n\nAs soon as the word emissions entered the language and became part of a religious ideology , electricity prices skyrocketed , electricity supply became more unreliable , subsidies for wind and solar energy went through the roof and employers and consumers had massive cost increases . Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save .\n\nThe Paris accord is non-binding . This is recognised by the major carbon dioxide emitters such as China , India and the US , which don ’ t comply . No EU state has met its target . Why should Australia be the only country out of step and aim for an impossible , bankrupting reduction of 26 per cent or more of our 2005 carbon dioxide emissions ?\n\nPragmatism and principled inaction is the correct policy to ­address the non-problem of human-induced climate change promoted by the Paris accord . But do our politicians have the courage to thoughtfully do nothing ?\n\nWe are in an electricity crisis because we are trying to decrease human emissions of carbon dioxide and have tied climate policy and electricity generation costs to emissions . A reality check is needed . Even if human-induced global warming could be shown , a reduction in Australian emissions , comprising 1.3 per cent of global annual emissions , is dwarfed by annual increases of 2 per cent globally and 4 per cent by China .\n\nAustralia ’ s symbolic suicidal climate policy just makes everybody poorer .\n\nWe face further turnover of prime ministers and governments until the costs and reliability of electricity are addressed and until the fundamentalist religious mantra that emissions drive global warming is rejected .\n\nPoliticians need to realise that the electorate wants cheap electricity and a reduction of emissions concurrent with subsidies for unreliable weather-dependent electricity can neither reduce costs nor increase reliability .\n\nMeanwhile , employment-generating businesses will close , household costs will become impossibly high , international competitiveness will fall and governments will change .\n\nEmissions must be banned . From the language . Not from coal-fired power stations that have provided cheap , reliable electricity for generations . It is only then that we will have stable government and cheap reliable electricity again .\n\nEmeritus professor Ian Plimer ’ s latest book , Climate Delusion and the Great Electricity Rip-Off , is published by Connor Court .\n\n", "label": [[612, 644, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [874, 899, "Faulty Generalization"], [989, 1068, "False Dilemma"], [1606, 1726, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1606, 1726, "Logical Fallacy"], [1070, 1097, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1876, 2001, "False Causality"], [1876, 2001, "Logical Fallacy"], [2963, 3044, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3178, 3219, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3263, 3274, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4806, 4824, "Ad Hominem"], [4734, 5018, "False Causality"], [5991, 6161, "Intentional"], [6163, 6239, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3973, 3989, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4183, 4213, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [5201, 5347, "Ad Populum"], [199, 284, "Intentional"], [284, 534, "Intentional"], [901, 987, "Intentional"], [1100, 1211, "Logical Fallacy"], [1386, 1603, "Faulty Generalization"], [2830, 2930, "Intentional"], [2932, 2961, "Logical Fallacy"], [536, 724, "Intentional"], [1263, 1386, "Faulty Generalization"], [1606, 1726, "Faulty Generalization"], [1774, 1876, "Intentional"], [2687, 2829, "Intentional"], [3045, 3151, "Intentional"], [3496, 3700, "False Causality"], [4734, 5019, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "https://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/repeat-after-me-carbon-dioxide-is-good-for-us/news-story/3351d99047e42ab2719250ec26aa6931", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/op-ed-in-the-australian-gets-nearly-every-fact-wrong-ian-plimer/"}
{"id": 766, "data": "A domino-like cascade of melting ice , warming seas , shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “ hothouse ” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile , a group of leading climate scientists has warned .\n\nThis grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes , including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic .\n\nThe authors of the essay , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , stress their analysis is not conclusive , but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “ park ” the planet ’ s climate at a stable temperature .\n\nThey warn that the hothouse trajectory “ would almost certainly flood deltaic environments , increase the risk of damage from coastal storms , and eliminate coral reefs ( and all of the benefits that they provide for societies ) by the end of this century or earlier . ”\n\n“ I do hope we are wrong , but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real , ” said Johan Rockström , executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre . “ We need to know now . It ’ s so urgent . This is one of the most existential questions in science . ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRockström and his co-authors are among the world ’ s leading authorities on positive feedback loops , by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth ’ s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat .\n\nTheir new paper asks whether the planet ’ s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state . The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “ hothouse ” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life .\n\nKatherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen , one of the authors , said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions , but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level .\n\n“ We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system , itself , will ‘ want ’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions , ” she said . “ This implies not only reducing emissions but much more . ”\n\nNew feedback loops are still being discovered . A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane .\n\nPrevious studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C , forest dieback will add 0.11C , permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C . The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles .\n\nRockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another . Contrary to the Gaia theory , which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency , he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state .\n\nAs an example , the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current , which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean , which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic . Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years .\n\nCurrently , global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade . The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century , but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary .\n\n“ The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming , ” Rockström said . “ Several positive feedback loops are already in operation , but they are still weak . We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect .\n\nAnother climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory . “ It ’ s rather selective , but not outlandish , ” said Prof Martin Siegert , co-director of the Grantham Institute . “ Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously , but to state that 2C is a threshold we can ’ t pull back from is new , I think . I ’ m not sure what ‘ evidence ’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it . ”\n\nRockström said the question needed asking . “ We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming , but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away , ” he said . “ We don ’ t say this will definitely happen . We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago , this would be dismissed as alarmist , but now scientists have become really worried . ”\n\n“ In the context of the summer of 2018 , this is definitely not a case of crying wolf , raising a false alarm : the wolves are now in sight , ” said Dr Phil Williamson , a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia . “ The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard , not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible , but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late . ”", "label": [[0, 211, "Faulty Generalization"], [271, 284, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4386, 4419, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-potential-future-hothouse-climate-generally-accurate-but-misstates-details-jonathan-watts/"}

Japan recorded its highest temperature in history , 106 degrees , in a heat wave that killed 65 people in a week and hospitalized 22,000 , shortly after catastrophic flooding killed 200 .\nOuargla , Algeria , hit 124 degrees on July 5 , a likely record for the continent of Africa . And the 109-degree reading in Quriyat , Oman , on June 28 amazed meteorologists because that wasn ’ t the day ’ s high temperature . That was the low . It was the hottest low temperature ever recorded on Earth .\nMontreal hit 98 degrees on July 2 , its warmest temperature ever measured . Canadian health officials estimate as many as 70 people died in that heat wave .\nIn the United States , 35 weather stations in the past month have set new marks for warm overnight temperatures . Southern California has had record heat and widespread power outages . In Yosemite Valley , which is imperiled by wildfires , park rangers have told everyone to flee .\nThe brutal weather has been supercharged by human-induced climate change , scientists say . Climate models for three decades have predicted exactly what the world is seeing this summer .\nAnd they predict that it will get hotter — and that what is a record today could someday be the norm .\n“ The old records belong to a world that no longer exists , ” said Martin Hoerling , a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\nIt ’ s not just heat . A warming world is prone to multiple types of extreme weather — heavier downpours , stronger hurricanes , longer droughts .\n“ You see roads melting , airplanes not being able to take off , there ’ s not enough water , ” said Katharine Hayhoe , director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University . “ Climate change hits us at our Achilles ’ heel . In the Southwest , it ’ s water availability . On the Gulf Coast , it ’ s hurricanes . In the East , it ’ s flooding . It ’ s exacerbating the risks we already face today . ”\nThe proximate cause of the Northern Hemisphere bake-off is the unusual behavior of the jet stream , a wavy track of west-to-east-prevailing wind at high altitude . The jet stream controls broad weather patterns , such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems . The extent of climate change ’ s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research .\nThis summer , the jet stream has undulated in extreme waves that have tended to block weather systems from migrating . The result has been stagnant high-pressure and low-pressure systems with dire results , such as heat waves in some places and flooding elsewhere .\n“ When those waves are very big — as they have been for the past few weeks — they tend to get stuck in place , ” said Jennifer Francis , a professor of atmospheric science at Rutgers University . Last year , scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “ stuck jet streams ” are becoming more common , with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit .\nGone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate . Now researchers can examine a weather event and estimate how much climate change had to do with causing or exacerbating it .\nLast year , when Hurricane Harvey broke the record for how much rain could fall from a single storm , researchers knew climate change had been a factor .\nMonths later , scientists presented findings that Harvey dumped at least 15 percent more rain in Houston than it would have without global warming . Theory , meet reality : When the atmosphere is warmer , it can hold more moisture . Climate change does not cause hurricanes to spin up or thunderstorms to develop , but it can be an intensifier .\nIn Dallas , where the temperature hit 100 on 10 out of 11 days this month , three homeless people have died of heat-related causes in the past week , said Brenda Snitzer , executive director of the Stewpot , a downtown shelter .\nIn Phoenix , where this week ’ s temperature hit 116 degrees , Dustin Nye , 36 , who spent the day installing air-conditioning units , said he has suffered heat stroke in the past and still gets woozy . “ It takes a special breed to do this all day long in this heat , ” he said . “ You ’ ve really got to work up your endurance and just buckle down and deal with it . ”\nIn Los Angeles , Marty Adams , chief operating officer of the Department of Water and Power , said , “ It seems like every year , we ’ ve had some type of temperature anomaly that we normally would not have. ” Residents of beach cities such as Long Beach and Santa Monica , who normally rely on the ocean breeze to cool their homes , have added air-conditioning units , which strains the grid and has contributed to power outages , he said .\nSaid Hayhoe : “ The biggest myth that the largest number of people have bought into is that ‘ climate change doesn ’ t matter to me personally. ’ ”\nThe heat waves have hit hard where people don ’ t expect them — the Netherlands , Sweden , Britain , Ireland and Canada .\n“ Our office doesn ’ t have air conditioning . I do have a fan , ” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh , a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute . He spoke by phone from the city of Gouda , where the temperature hit 96 degrees Thursday .\n“ This kind of event was a 1-in-100-year event in 1900 , ” he said . “ It ’ s become 20 times more likely . ”\nIt ’ s Britain ’ s driest summer since modern records began in 1961 . Reservoirs are declining rapidly , and water restrictions are in effect . The United Kingdom ’ s national weather service urged people to avoid the sun this week , with temperatures expected to hit 98 Fahrenheit .\nIn Ireland , the sun-parched fields revealed a previously hidden footprint of a 5,000-year-old monument near Newgrange .\nHuman activity , primarily the burning of fossil fuels , has added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere , trapping heat and making extreme weather events even more extreme . The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 410 parts per million in May , the highest the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii had measured since Charles David Keeling started keeping records in 1958 . NASA estimates Earth has warmed almost one degree Celsius ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) since the late 1800s . Of that , half a degree ( around one degree F ) has accrued since 1990 alone .\nIf nothing is done to curb greenhouse-gas emissions , scientists say , the global temperature increase could reach nine degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century , with higher spikes on land and at high latitudes . The Paris agreement , signed by every country in the world , is designed to limit that temperature spike through commitments to cut greenhouse-gas emissions over time . President Trump , who in the past has called global warming a hoax , has vowed to pull the United States out of the accord as soon as that becomes possible , in 2020 .\nThe 2017 National Climate Assessment , released in November , concluded what it has for nearly three decades : Human-made climate change is real , and the impacts have already started .\nAverage temperature is rising rapidly across the United States . Heat waves are becoming more extreme and will continue to do so .\n\nOverall precipitation has decreased in the South and West and increased in the North and East . That trend will continue . The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme . Snowpack will continue to decline . Large wildfires will become even more frequent .\nKevin Trenberth , a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said even modest heat from global warming can build up over time .\n“ The accumulated energy over one month is equivalent to a small microwave oven at full power for six minutes over every square foot of the planet , ” Trenberth said . “ No wonder things catch on fire . ”", "label": [[5233, 5282, "Intentional"], [3388, 3469, "False Dilemma"], [7142, 7208, "Intentional"], [0, 1559, "Intentional"], [2213, 2331, "Intentional"], [4097, 5138, "Intentional"], [7160, 7208, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [7142, 7297, "False Causality"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/climate-change-is-supercharging-a-hot-and-dangerous-summer/2018/07/26/cf960ba8-905c-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-story-puts-recent-weather-extremes-in-accurate-climate-change-context-joel-achenbach-angela-fritz/"}
{"id": 771, "data": "One of the most important numbers in the world goes by the catchy title of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity , or ECS . It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases . More formally , it is defined as the increase , in degrees Celsius , of average temperatures around the world , after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change . The reason it ’ s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change .\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius , but it can ’ t be more precise than that . Which is too bad , because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value . People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say , less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and , in many places , mildly beneficial . If it is very low , for instance around one , it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about . But if ECS is high — say , around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem . We may not be able to stop it , but we ’ d better get ready to adapt to it .\n\nSo , somebody , somewhere , ought to measure ECS . As it turns out , a lot of people have been trying , and what they have found has enormous policy implications .\n\nTo understand why , we first need to delve into the methodology a bit . There are two ways scientists try to estimate ECS . The first is to use a climate model , double the modeled CO2 concentration from the pre-industrial level , and let it run until temperatures stabilize a few hundred years into the future . This approach , called the model-based method , depends for its accuracy on the validity of the climate model , and since models differ quite a bit from one another , it yields a wide range of possible answers . A well-known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method . It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees , possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower , and possibly as high as nine degrees . This range of potential warming is very influential on economic analyses of the costs of climate change .\n\nThe second method is to use long-term historical data on temperatures , solar activity , carbon-dioxide emissions and atmospheric chemistry to estimate ECS using a simple statistical model derived by applying the law of conservation of energy to the planetary atmosphere . This is called the Energy Balance method . It relies on some extrapolation to satisfy the definition of ECS but has the advantage of taking account of the available data showing how the actual atmosphere has behaved over the past 150 years .\n\nThe surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates . The accompanying chart compares the model-based range to ECS estimates from a dozen Energy Balance studies over the past decade . Clearly these two methods give differing answers , and the question of which one is more accurate is important .\n\nClimate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy . One is called the “ emergent constraint ” approach . The idea is that models yield a range of ECS values , and while we can ’ t measure ECS directly , the models also yield estimates of a lot of other things that we can measure ( such as the reflectivity of cloud tops ) , so we could compare those other measures to the data , and when we do , sometimes the models with high ECS values also yield measures of secondary things that fit the data better than models with low ECS values .\n\nThis argument has been a bit of a tough sell , since the correlations involved are often weak , and it doesn ’ t explain why the Energy Balance results are so low .\n\nThe second approach is based on so-called “ forcing efficacies , ” which is the concept that climate forcings , such as greenhouse gases and aerosol pollutants , differ in their effectiveness over time and space , and if these variations are taken into account the Energy Balance sensitivity estimates may come out higher . This , too , has been a controversial suggestion .\n\nA recent Energy Balance ECS estimate was just published in the Journal of Climate by Nicholas Lewis and Judith Curry . There are several features that make their study especially valuable . First , they rely on IPCC estimates of greenhouse gases , solar changes and other climate forcings , so they can ’ t be accused of putting a finger on the scale by their choice of data . Second , they take into account the efficacy issue and discuss it at length . They also take into account recent debates about how surface temperatures should or shouldn ’ t be measured , and how to deal with areas like the Arctic where data are sparse . Third , they compute their estimates over a variety of start and end dates to check that their ECS estimate is not dependent on the relative warming hiatus of the past two decades .\n\nIt looks like the climate models we have been using for decades need to be revised\n\nTheir ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees , with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees . If the study was a one-time outlier we might be able to ignore it . But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams ( as this interactive graphic shows ) , using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges , all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases .\n\nPolicy-makers need to pay attention , because this debate directly impacts the carbon-tax discussion .\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency uses social cost of carbon models that rely on the model-based ECS estimates . Last year , two colleagues and I published a study in which we took an earlier Lewis and Curry ECS estimate and plugged it into two of those models . The result was that the estimated economic damages of greenhouse gas emissions fell by between 40 and 80 per cent , and in the case of one model the damages had a 40 per cent probability of being negative for the next few decades — that is , they would be beneficial changes . The new Lewis and Curry ECS estimate is even lower than their old one , so if we re-did the same study we would find even lower social costs of carbon .\n\nIf ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests , it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised . It also means that greenhouse gas emissions do not have as big an impact on the climate as has been claimed , and the case for costly policy measures to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions is much weaker than governments have told us . For a science that was supposedly “ settled ” back in the early 1990s , we sure have a lot left to learn .", "label": [[2156, 2199, "Intentional"], [2936, 3007, "Intentional"], [1159, 1336, "Intentional"], [1011, 1028, "Intentional"], [1031, 1336, "False Dilemma"], [895, 914, "Intentional"], [4356, 4474, "Intentional"], [5434, 5479, "Intentional"], [6173, 6282, "Intentional"], [6330, 6482, "Faulty Generalization"], [6484, 6542, "Intentional"], [4650, 4730, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/ross-mckitrick-all-those-warming-climate-predictions-suddenly-have-a-big-new-problem", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-commentary-misleads-warming-effect-greenhouse-gas-emissions-cherry-picking-studies-ross-mckitrick/"}
{"id": 772, "data": "Antarctica ’ s ice sheet is melting at a rapidly increasing rate , now pouring more than 200 billion tons of ice into the ocean annually and raising sea levels a half-millimeter every year , a team of 80 scientists reported Wednesday .\nThe melt rate has tripled in the past decade , the study concluded . If the acceleration continues , some of scientists ’ worst fears about rising oceans could be realized , leaving low-lying cities and communities with less time to prepare than they had hoped .\nThe result also reinforces that nations have a short window — perhaps no more than a decade — to cut greenhouse-gas emissions if they hope to avert some of the worst consequences of climate change .\nAntarctica , the planet ’ s largest ice sheet , lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion-ton melt rate of a decade ago , the scientists concluded . From 1992 through 1997 , Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually .\nThe study is the product of a large group of Antarctic experts who collectively reviewed 24 recent measurements of Antarctic ice loss , reconciling their differences to produce the most definitive figures yet on changes in Antarctica . Their results — known formally as the “ Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-Comparison Exercise ” ( IMBIE ) — were published Wednesday in the journal Nature .\n“ We took all the estimates across all the different techniques , and we got this consensus , ” said Isabella Velicogna , an Antarctic expert at the University of California at Irvine and one of the many authors from institutions in 14 countries . The lead authors was Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in England and Erik Ivins of NASA ’ s Jet Propulsion Laboratory .\n“ The detailed record shows an acceleration , starting around 2002 , ” Beata Csatho , one of the study authors and a glaciologist at the University at Buffalo , said in an email .\n\nCsatho noted that comparing the first and last five-year periods in the record reveals an even steeper acceleration . “ Actually , if you compare 1997-2002 to 2012-2017 , the increase is even larger , a factor of more than 5 ! ! ” she wrote .\nFor the total period from 1992 through the present , the ice sheet has lost nearly 3 trillion tons of ice , equating to just less than 8 millimeters of sea-level rise . Forty percent of that loss has occurred in the past five years .\nThe rapid , recent changes are almost entirely driven by the West Antarctic ice sheet , which scientists have long viewed as an Achilles ’ heel . It is known to be losing ice rapidly because it is being melted from below by warm ocean waters , a process that is rendering its largest glaciers unstable .\nWest Antarctica lost 159 billion tons of ice a year from 2012 through 2017 , compared with 65 billion tons from 2002 through 2007 .\nThe growth is largely attributable to just two huge glaciers : Pine Island and Thwaites . The latter is increasingly being viewed as posing a potential planetary emergency because of its enormous size and its role as a gateway that could allow the ocean to someday access the entirety of West Antarctica , turning the marine-based ice sheet into a new sea .\nPine Island is now losing about 45 billion tons per year , and Thwaites is losing 50 billion . Both numbers are higher than the annual losses for any other glacier in the world .\n“ The increasing mass loss that they ’ re finding is really worrying , particularly looking at the West Antarctic , the area that ’ s changing most rapidly , ” said Christine Dow , a glaciologist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario who was not involved in the research . “ And it ’ s the area that we ’ re most worried about , because it ’ s below sea level . ”\n“ If you start removing mass from there , you can have a very large-scale evacuation of ice into the ocean and significant sea-level rise , ” Dow said .\nDow is the lead author of a just-published study outlining one process that could be driving , and could worsen , some of Antarctica ’ s ice losses .\nShe and her co-authors found that at numerous major glaciers including Pine Island , warm ocean waters are helping to carve out deep crevasses underneath the floating ice shelves that brace these glaciers in place . The shelves then tend to crack at these thinned-out points and break off large pieces , weakening their ability to hold back the flow of glacial ice into the ocean .\n“ Anywhere you have thinner ice , it ’ s going to be weaker , ” Dow said .\nIn addition to West Antarctica , another increase in ice losses in the past decade came from the smaller glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula , which are also melting rapidly but contain less potential to raise the sea level .\nThe largest part of the continent , East Antarctica , has remained more stable and did not contribute much melt to the ocean during the period of study , the assessment says . However , in the past five years , it too has begun to lose ice , perhaps as much as 28 billion tons per year , although the uncertainty surrounding this number remains high .\nWhat ’ s happening in East Antarctica is important because it has , by far , the most ice to give , being capable of raising sea levels by well over 100 feet . A single East Antarctic glacier , Totten , has the potential to unleash as much total sea-level rise as the entire West Antarctic ice sheet , or more .\n“ We can not count on East Antarctica to be the quiet player , and we start to observe change there in some sectors that have potential , and they ’ re vulnerable , ” Velicogna said .\nScientists have previously raised fears about a scenario in which ice loss from Antarctica takes on an explosive rate .\nIn a controversial 2016 study , former NASA scientist James Hansen and a team of colleagues , including Velicogna , found that Earth ’ s sea level could rise above one meter ( or 3.3 feet ) within 50 years if polar ice-sheet loss doubles every 10 years . A tripling every decade , were it to continue , would reach that volume of sea level rise even sooner .\nThere is no proof the current rate of change in Antarctica will continue . Scientists can ’ t see the future , but they do fear continuing and even worsening losses .\n“ I don ’ t know if it ’ s going to keep exactly tripling , but I think it has a lot of potential to keep significantly increasing , ” Velicogna said .\nThe changes will not be steady , in any case , said Knut Christianson , an Antarctic researcher at the University of Washington . “ We will not necessarily see solely rapid retreat , ” Christianson in an email , noting that as glaciers such as Pine Island retreat down a submarine , downhill slope , they will sometimes encounter bumps that slow their movement . So we should expect “ periods of stability interspersed with rapid retreat , ” he said .\nUnder high greenhouse-gas emissions , the worst-case projections of sea-level rise eventually reach over a centimeter each year , said Rob DeConto , an Antarctic expert at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who was not involved in the new study .\nWe ’ re nowhere near that point yet .\n“ We ’ re still talking about roughly a half a millimeter per year , ” DeConto said . “ That isn ’ t going to sound horribly unmanageable . But remember for the Northern Hemisphere , for North America , the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea-level rise by up to about an additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York . ”\nThat ’ s because as Antarctica ’ s mass shrinks , the ice sheet ’ s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat , and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination .\nWhether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today , argued DeConto , who co-authored a separate paper in this week ’ s Nature outlining two visions of Antarctica in 2070 .\nContinuing high emissions could deliver massive sea-level rise — but strong compliance with the Paris climate agreement , while unable to stop changes happening now , could help to control how much they worsen .\n“ The kinds of changes that we see today , if they were not to increase much more . . . then maybe we ’ re talking about something that is manageable for coastal stakeholders , ” DeConto said .\nOr alternatively , he continued , Antarctica could drive faster changes , ones that “ begin to exceed what we ’ re going to be able to cope with . ”", "label": [[6056, 6073, "Intentional"], [7042, 7080, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [358, 369, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [6167, 6220, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/06/13/antarctic-ice-loss-has-tripled-in-a-decade-if-that-continues-we-are-in-serious-trouble/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-article-accurately-describes-latest-estimate-accelerating-antarctic-ice-loss-chris-mooney/"}
{"id": 773, "data": "Tropical cyclones , including hurricanes and typhoons , are now crawling across the planet at a slower pace than they did decades ago , dragging out and amplifying their devastation , new research published Wednesday shows .\n\nAt the same time , related research published just last month suggests that warming temperatures from climate change will slow storms more in the future .\n\nWhile having a cyclone travel with less speed may seem like a good thing , it 's actually just the opposite . Wind speeds within the storm remain high , but the whole system itself moves slower across the landscape , allowing punishing rains to linger longer over communities .\n\nTaken together , these two studies suggest that climate change is already increasing the dangers posed by hurricanes and typhoons in far more ways than previously thought , and it will continue to compound many of the hazards , especially the threat of severe flooding .\n\n`` Nothing good comes out of a slowing storm , '' says James Kossin , with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Center for Weather and Climate in Madison , Wisconsin , and author of the first paper , published today in the journal Nature . `` It can increase storm surge . It can increase the amount of time that structures are subjected to strong wind . And it increases rainfall . ''\n\nDriving Devastation\nIn the wake of Hurricane Harvey 's torrential rains , which dumped several feet of water on sections of Houston , Texas , last August , scientists showed that warmer sea and air temperatures pumped more moisture into the storm—which then fell as rain . Climate change increased both the intensity of the rainfall and the likelihood that the storm would occur .\n\n13 Photos of Extreme Weather\nIn his paper , Kossin found yet another way changes in storm patterns are sparking greater devastation . He showed that from 1949 to 2016 , tropical cyclones across the globe slowed their movement by 10 percent on average . In some regions , the pace of those storms slowed even more as they hit land . In the western North Pacific , the decline was almost a third . That means a storm that may already hold more moisture will have time to drop more of it in each spot .\n\nWith the exception of the Indian Ocean region , which tends to behave differently , `` all the other regions show this consistent slowing , '' Kossin says . `` The trend is always in one direction . ''\n\nKossin 's work was based on details of almost 70 years ' worth of storms , but he made no attempt to determine what was causing the slowdown . Still , the shift is precisely what he and other cyclone experts said would be expected from climate change . With polar regions warming faster than other parts of the globe , that is altering pressure gradients , reducing the winds that push these storms .\n\n`` Tropical cyclones are just carried along by the wind , so it makes sense , '' Kossin says . `` The storms will stay in your neighborhoods longer . ''\n\nChristina Patricola , a scientist with the climate and ecosystem sciences division of California 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , called Kossin 's work `` important and new '' and says she found it `` pretty convincing . ''\n\n`` I was not surprised by his findings , '' she says . `` But I was surprised by the magnitude of the slowdown . ''\n\nIn an editorial accompanying Kossin 's work , she points out that it raises several new questions . For instance , if exceptionally slow-moving storms have grown more likely in recent years , does that mean `` stalled '' storms like Harvey—which seemed to get stuck in place for days—are increasing , too ?\n\nKossi hopes that scientists will begin building models that show which communities are likely to face the most risk . Given that storms in some regions are migrating poleward and already increasing in intensity , cyclones delivering unusually powerful bouts of rain may threaten places not normally in their path . `` These are not good things to be combining , '' he says .\n\nIncreasing Flooding ?\nIn the second study , published in the Journal of Climate , a team led by Ethan Gutmann , with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , tried to see how 22 hurricanes that hit in the last 13 years might be different if they hit in the future under a warmer climate .\n\nBy plugging storm data into computer models representing a future with temperatures that are up to five degrees warmer , they found that these cyclones moved 9 percent slower and were far , far wetter . Rainfall , on average , increased 24 percent .\n\n`` We 're showing that it not only slows down , but that it 's more intense , '' Gutmann says . `` That has serious implications for inland flooding and urban infrastructure . ''\n\nGutmann and Kossin took entirely different approaches—one looking at historical data ; the other using modeling to see how storms would behave under predicted warming scenarios . And there are limits to each approach . No storm from today will reproduce in quite the same way in the future .\n\nBut both scientists say the importance is in the bigger picture . The fact that their results show quite similar trends should be a wake-up call .\n\n`` We 're both pushing the work forward and adding additional lines of evidence , '' Gutmann says . `` And when you start getting more and more lines of evidence that all point in the same direction , you get more confident in the answers .

{"id": 778, "data": "Climate Change : Scientists just discovered a massive , heretofore unknown , source of nitrogen . Why does this matter ? Because it could dramatically change those dire global warming forecasts that everybody claims are based on `` settled science . ''\n\nThe researchers , whose findings were published in the prestigious journal Science , say they 've determined that the idea that the only source of nitrogen for plant life came from the air is wrong . There are vast storehouses in the planet 's bedrock that plants also feed on .\n\nThis is potentially huge news , since what it means is that there is a vastly larger supply of nitrogen than previously believed .\n\nUniversity of California at Davis environmental scientist and co-author of the study , Ben Houlton , says that `` This runs counter the centuries-long paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental sciences . ''\n\nPay close attention to the word `` paradigm . ''\n\nIf Houlton 's finding about these vast , previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true , then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions .\n\nClimate scientists have long known that plants offset some of the effects of climate change by absorbing and storing CO2 . But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited .\n\nAs a 2003 study published in the same Science journal put it , `` there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios . ''\n\nIn the wake of the latest findings , Ronald Amundson , a soil biogeochemist at the University of California at Berkeley , told Chemical and Engineering News that `` If there is more nitrogen there than expected , then the constraints on plant growth in a high-CO2 world may not be as great as we think . ''\n\nIn other words , with more nitrogen available , plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating , which means the planet wo n't warm as much , despite mankind 's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere .\n\nA Stunning Finding\nHoulton has been exploring this possibility for years . Back in 2011 , he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock .\n\nAt the time , he said `` the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change , '' because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say .\n\nThe question is whether any climate scientists or environmentalists — who are entirely wedded to the idea that industrialization is destroying the planet — would ever admit this .\n\nThat 's why that word `` paradigm '' is important .\n\nAs we 've noted in this space , the idea of `` settled science '' peddled by environmentalists and politicians defies the history of science , which has seen repeated upheavals of previous forms of `` settled science . ''\n\nThomas Kuhn studied this phenomenon in his 1962 book `` The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions . '' He explained how scientists develop a theory — or paradigm — based on available evidence — to explain what they 're seeing .\n\nOnce that paradigm takes hold , scientists are often loath to give up on it even if evidence piles up that it might be wrong . Eventually , however , faulty paradigms do give way , ushering in a new scientific paradigm . Examples of such paradigm shifts in the past : heliocentric solar system , continental drift , Einstein 's theories .\n\nA Coming Paradigm Shift ?\nThat same thing might be happening right now with climate science .\n\nAs we 've said many times , evidence continues to show weaknesses in climate models used to predict future warming . They failed to predict a decade-long pause in global temperatures . Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized . And a recent paper published in Nature concluded that the planet is less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the computer models say .\n\nMeanwhile , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been conducting highly suspicious temperature data manipulation . The changes in the temperature data consistently make the past seem cooler , which in turn makes the present seem warmer .\n\nThis creates a data illusion of ever-rising temperatures to match the increase in CO2 in the Earth 's atmosphere .\n\nMarc Morano , editor of the popular ClimateDepot blog and author of `` The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change , '' notes that `` science is not supposed to have a politically predetermined outcome pushed by ideology and politics . This new nitrogen study is but one example of consensus science being overturned . The global warming science establishment should now be open to similar studies and dissenting voices on CO2 to overturn the alleged climate change consensus . ''\n\nBut will they ?\n\nWith their reputations and huge amounts government grant money at stake , it 's unlikely that many climate scientists would ever admit to being wrong . No matter how obvious it became that they were .", "label": [[1390, 1548, "Intentional"], [892, 940, "Intentional"], [2538, 2717, "Intentional"], [2608, 2691, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2890, 2992, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2890, 2992, "Faulty Generalization"], [2995, 3560, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2995, 3560, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2995, 3560, "Faulty Generalization"], [3928, 4061, "Intentional"], [4925, 4940, "Intentional"], [4942, 5013, "Ad Hominem"], [4942, 5142, "Intentional"], [3774, 3840, "Intentional"], [3842, 3928, "Intentional"], [1225, 1388, "Intentional"], [28, 95, "Intentional"], [1036, 1099, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/global-warming-computer-model-nitrogen-rocks/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/investors-business-daily-editorial-misrepresents-study-to-claim-plants-will-prevent-dangerous-climate-change/"}
{"id": 779, "data": "For some time , scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich , frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts : They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide , which , though a greenhouse gas , drives warming more slowly than some other gases . Scientists obviously weren ’ t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions , but it was better than the alternative : methane , a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming .\nNow even that silver lining is in doubt .\nResearch released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws . The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils , where oxygen is not prevalent , tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane , a gas that doesn ’ t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years .\n\n“ What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies , ” said Christian Knobloch , a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study , published in Nature Climate Change .\nThe Arctic is full of toxic mercury , and climate change is going to release it\nThe divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment , more than seven years long , monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory , and gradually seeing sensitive methane-producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time .\nKnoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long , and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane-generating microorganisms to really get cranking .\n“ What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced , and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long , ” Knoblauch said .\nThe research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany , Sweden and Russia .\nSo much methane was produced in the experiment , the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils , or wetlands , will be higher than from drier soils , where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released . This finding , if further confirmed , could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century .\n‘ We all knew this was coming ’ : Alaska ’ s thawing soils are now pouring carbon dioxide into the air\nFor instance , one major study of the permafrost warming potential , published in 2015 in the journal Nature , played down the potential for methane release in wet soils , saying drier soils would be the bigger problem .\n“ In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4 , a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier , aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment , ” that research found . The new study would appear to contradict this .\nBut Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades . It will be important to know , for instance , how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones .\nOne Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research , Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph , praised the new study , noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane-producing organisms in watery soil . The research , she said , could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas .\n“ What ’ s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities , and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other , ” Turetsky said .\nWarming of the Arctic is ‘ unprecedented over the last 1,500 years , ’ scientists say\nShe said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it , which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won ’ t change in light of the new research . But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane , as opposed to carbon dioxide , will be crucial , she said , and remains to be determined .\n“ We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms , because it really matters , ” Turetsky said . “ So I think that has got to be where the community goes next . ”\nBut Róisín Commane , a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research , was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane .\nThe study was “ very nicely done , ” she said , but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors . The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide . And , as the Arctic continues to warm , soils might not retain as much water , as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way , she noted .\n“ How much of it makes it into the atmosphere is the big thing , ” Commane said . “ Ecosystems will probably produce more methane as they stay wet . The big question we have is , how much of that makes it into the atmosphere , and I don ’ t think they get to that question here . ”", "label": [[5094, 5127, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [551, 592, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/03/19/the-arctics-carbon-bomb-might-be-even-more-potent-than-we-thought/?utm_term=.11dbcfb64830", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-accurately-covers-permafrost-study-albeit-under-a-somewhat-sensational-headline-chris-mooney/"}
{"id": 783, "data": "Ecoanxiety is an emerging condition . Named in 2011 , the American Psychological Association recently described it as the dread and helplessness that come with “ watching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold , and worrying about the future for oneself , children , and later generations . ”\n\nIt ’ s not a formal diagnosis . Anxiety is traditionally defined by an outsized stress response to a given stimulus . In this case , the stimulus is real , as are the deleterious effects of stress on the body .\n\nThis sort of disposition toward ecological-based distress does not pair well with a president who has denied the reality of the basis for this anxiety . Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of “ the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. ” He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord , and who has appointed fossil-fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency .\n\nFor people who experience climate-related anxiety , this all serves as a sort of exacerbation by presidential gaslight . The remedy for a condition like this is knowing what can be done to mitigate environmental degradation , from within in a country singularly committed to it .\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\n\nTo Save the World , Eat Bugs\nCAYTE BOSLER\n\nBeyond ‘ Vegetarian ’\nBRIAN KATEMAN\n\nWill We Ever Stop Eating Animal Meat ?\nDEREK THOMPSON\nLike what ?\n\nHelen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition , a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability . She ’ s interested in policy , but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership . So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals . As with so many things in life and health , that tends to come down to food .\n\nRecently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University , Bard College , and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change : substituting beans for beef . They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals , pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009 .\n\nThat is , even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target .\n\n“ I think there ’ s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have , ” Harwatt told me . There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism , but this study is novel for the idea that a person ’ s dedication to the cause doesn ’ t have to be complete in order to matter . A relatively small , single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one ’ s car , or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs , and certainly more than quitting showering .\n\nTo understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large , note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest . The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle , the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day . Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows , and the cows will convert the beans to meat , and the humans will eat the meat . In the process , the cows will emit much greenhouse gas , and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat , meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people .\n\nThis inefficient process happens on a massive scale . Brazil , the world ’ s largest exporter of red meat , holds around 212 million cattle . ( In June , the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses , collections of pus , in the meat . ) According to the United Nations , 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock . Even more , 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock . In all , almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products .\n\nThis means much less deforestation and land degradation if so many plant crops weren ’ t run through the digestive tracts of cattle . If Americans traded their beef for beans , the researchers found , that would free up 42 percent of U.S. crop land .\n\n“ The real beauty of this kind of thing is that climate impact doesn ’ t have to be policy-driven , ” said Harwatt . “ It can just be a positive , empowering thing for consumers to see that they can make a significant impact by doing something as simple as eating beans instead of beef . ”\n\nShe and her colleagues conclude in the journal Climatic Change : “ While not currently recognized as a climate policy option , the ‘ beans for beef ’ scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits , illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts . ”\n\nThe beans for beef scenario is , it seems , upon us .\n\n“ I think it ’ s such an easy-to-grasp concept that it could be less challenging than a whole dietary shift , ” said Harwatt . The words vegetarian and vegan have stifled some people ’ s thinking on what it means to eat well—to consume responsibly , conscientiously . Rather the beans for beef scenario is the dietary equivalent of effective altruism—focusing on where efforts will have the highest yield . “ It ’ s kind of a worst-first approach , looking at the hottest spot in the food system in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions , and what could that be substituted with without losing protein and calories in the food system ? And at the same time , gaining health benefits . ”\n\nIn addition to the well-documented health benefits of a plant-based diet , this case also brings empowerment , or at least reprieve . Regardless of a person ’ s degree of ecoanxiety , there is some recourse in knowing how far individuals can go to make up for a regressive federal administration simply by eating beans .", "label": [[4159, 4285, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [6248, 6304, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [688, 822, "Intentional"], [712, 822, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4171, 4282, "Logical Fallacy"]], "source_url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef/535536/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-climate-implications-reduced-beef-consumption-provide-clearer-context-james-hamblin/"}
{"id": 784, "data": "There is no scientific consensus over whether global warming is to blame . But the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula has been fundamentally changed , according to Project Midas , a research team from Swansea University and Aberystwyth University in Britain that had been monitoring the rift since 2014 .\n\n“ The remaining shelf will be at its smallest ever known size , ” said Adrian Luckman , a lead researcher for Project Midas . “ This is a big change . Maps will need to be redrawn . ”\n\nThin sea ice\n\nIce shelf\n\n820 FEET DEEP\n\n900 FEET\n\nRift seen from space\n\nBeginning of rift about 40 miles from the edge\n\n10 MILES\n\nSentinel-1 SAR imagery | Captured May 31\n\nPhoto by John Sonntag | Captured Nov. 10\n\nLarsen C , like two smaller ice shelves that collapsed before it , was holding back relatively little land ice , and it is not expected to contribute much to the rise of the sea . But in other parts of Antarctica , similar shelves are holding back enormous amounts of ice , and scientists fear that their future collapse could dump enough ice into the ocean to raise the sea level by many feet . How fast this could happen is unclear .\n\nIn the late 20th century , the Antarctic Peninsula , which juts out from the main body of Antarctica and points toward South America , was one of the fastest-warming places in the world . That warming had slowed or perhaps reversed slightly in the 21st century , but scientists believe the ice is still catching up to the higher temperatures .\n\nSome climate scientists believe the warming in the region was at least in part a consequence of human-caused climate change , while others have disputed that , seeing a large role for natural variability — and noting that icebergs have been breaking away from ice shelves for many millions of years . But the two camps agree that the breakup of ice shelves in the peninsula region may be a preview of what is in store for the main part of Antarctica as the world continues heating up as a result of human activity .\n\n“ While it might not be caused by global warming , it ’ s at least a natural laboratory to study how breakups will occur at other ice shelves to improve the theoretical basis for our projections of future sea level rise , ” said Thomas P. Wagner , who leads NASA ’ s efforts to study the polar regions .\n\nThe time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year .\n\nIn frigid regions , ice shelves form as the long rivers of ice called glaciers flow from land into the sea . The result is a bit like a clog in a drain pipe , slowing the flow of the glaciers feeding them . When an ice shelf collapses , the glaciers behind it can accelerate , as though the drain pipe had suddenly cleared .\n\nAt the remaining part of Larsen C , the edge is now much closer to a line that scientists call the compressive arch , which is critical for structural support . If the front retreats past that line , the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months .\n\n“ At that point in time , the glaciers will react , ” said Eric Rignot , a climate scientist at the University of California , Irvine , who has done extensive research on polar ice . “ If the ice shelf breaks apart , it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it . The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow , effectively removing a cork in front of them . ”\n\nScientists also fear that two crucial anchor points will be lost .\nAccording to Dr. Rignot , the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened , as the shelf front thins .\n\n“ You have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is , ” he said . “ If the shelf is getting thinner , it will be more breakable , and it will lose contact with the ice rises . ”\n\nLow shelf support\n\nHigh\n\nIf the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises , a rapid retreat will be triggered .\n\nSHELF FRONT\n\nBawden Ice Rise\n\nGipps Ice Rise\n\nICE SHELF\n\nNORTH\n\nPENINSULA\n\nGLACIERS\n\nSOUTH\n\nPENINSULA\n\nGLACIERS\n\nIce rises are islands that are overridden by the ice shelf , allowing them to shoulder more of the weight of the shelf . Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises , though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was more vulnerable .\n\n“ We ’ re not even sure how it ’ s hanging on there , ” he said . “ But if you take away Bawden , the whole shelf will feel it . ”\n\nThe Antarctic Peninsula may be a canary in a coal mine .\nThe collapse of the peninsula ’ s ice shelves can be interpreted as fulfilling a prophecy made in 1978 by a renowned geologist named John H. Mercer of Ohio State University . In a classic paper , Dr. Mercer warned that the western part of Antarctica was so vulnerable to human-induced climate warming as to pose a “ threat of disaster ” from rising seas .\n\nHe said that humanity would know the calamity had begun when ice shelves started breaking up along the peninsula , with the breakups moving progressively southward .\n\nThe Larsen A ice shelf broke up over several years starting in 1995 ; the Larsen B underwent a dramatic collapse in 2002 ; and now , scientists fear , the calving of the giant iceberg could be the first stage in the breakup of Larsen C .\n\n“ As climate warming progresses farther south , ” Dr. Rignot said , “ it will affect larger and larger ice shelves , holding back bigger and bigger glaciers , so that their collapse will contribute more to sea-level rise . ”", "label": [[985, 1001, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/climate/antarctica-rift-update.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-iceberg-larsen-c-size-delaware-jugal-patel-justin-gillis/"}
{"id": 785, "data": "After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole , the Arctic has less sea ice at winter ’ s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements .\n\nThe extent of ice cover — a record low for the third straight year — is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic , a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change , scientists said .\n\n“ This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we ’ ve been seeing , ” said Mark Serreze , the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center , a government-backed research agency in Boulder , Colo. “ We ’ re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all . ”\n\nDr. Serreze said that such a situation , which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins , could occur by 2030 , although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that .\n\nThe melting of sea ice does not raise sea levels , but loss of ice coverage can disrupt ecosystems . For example , it can affect the timing of blooms of phytoplankton , the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain .\n\nLess ice coverage also means that there is more dark ocean to absorb more of the sun ’ s energy , which leads to more warming and melting in a feedback loop called Arctic amplification .\n\nThe data center said on Wednesday that sea ice in the Arctic had reached maximum extent , of about 5.5 million square miles , on March 7 . That is an area nearly twice the size of Australia , but about 470,000 square miles less than the average maximum from 1981 to 2010 .\n\nMuch of the ice also appears to be thinner than normal , Dr. Serreze said , another result of the unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic this winter .\n\nLate last fall , parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages , and at the pole itself , mean temperatures for November were 23 degrees above normal . There were similar temperature spikes in December and this year .\n\n“ The Arctic Ocean was extremely warm over the winter , and there was a very impressive series of heat waves , ” Dr. Serreze said . “ I ’ ve never seen anything like this before . ”\n\nLess coverage and thinner ice mean that this summer ’ s minimum , which is expected to occur in September , is likely to be low . But there is no direct link between the maximum in March and the minimum after the melting season , said Walt Meier , a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory .\n\n“ Just because it ’ s a record low maximum , there ’ s no prediction it will be a record low minimum in September , ” Dr. Meier said . “ But while a lot can happen in the summer , when you start out at such a low level , you ’ re not going to get a very high minimum . ”\n\nDr. Meier said that in addition to the low overall ice extent , some parts of the Arctic were almost completely devoid of ice this winter , including the Barents Sea off Norway and Russia .\n\n“ We haven ’ t seen much there at all , ” he said , “ and what there is will melt very quickly . ”", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/climate/arctic-winter-sea-ice-record-low-global-warming.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-accurately-covers-2017-record-low-arctic-winter-sea-ice-extent-henry-fountain/"}

The reef is home to 3,000 varieties of mollusks , over a hundred types of jellyfish , 1,625 species of fish , hundreds of shark and ray species , and over 30 kinds of whales and dolphins . These sea creatures call the soft and hard corals that make up the reef “ home. ” And without it , many of them will die .\n\nIf that ’ s not enough , it has the distinction of being the largest living structure on the planet .\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is home to 3,000 individual coral reefs stretching across a staggering 2,575 kilometers ( 1,600 miles ) , covering an area of about 344,400 square kilometers ( 133,000 square miles . )\n\nUnfortunately , because of back to back mass bleaching events , scientists are telling us that the massive , impressive Australian Great Barrier Reef is now at a ‘ terminal stage ’ —with large portions having no hope of recovery .\n\nMass bleaching , a phenomenon caused by global warming , is prompted when the water warms to a point that corals begin ejecting the symbiotic algae in their tissue , essential for their survival . Throughout history , there have only been four instances of this occurrence , and after such an event , it will take decades to recover .\n\n“ This is the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has bleached severely – in 1998 , 2002 , 2016 , and now in 2017 . Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals , but in the severe central region we anticipate high levels of coral loss , ” said researcher James Kerry , from James Cook University ’ s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies , in an official statement . He clarifies why the 2017 bleaching is significant : “ It takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest growing corals , so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016 . ”\n\nDEATH TOLL\nThe newest aerial surveys covered over 8,000 kilometers ( 5,000 ) miles , which includes 800 individual coral reefs .\n\nAccording to the surveys , 1,500 kilometers ( 932 miles ) of the Great Barrier Reef is now bleached . These new statistics come less than a year after 93 percent of the reef suffered severe damage , with reports adding that the effects have also spread further south .\n\nCombined with the mass bleaching event , the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Debbie added to the devastation , as it struck a section of the reef that managed to escape the worst of the bleaching .\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian , scientists note just how dire the situation is . “ We ’ ve given up , ” said Jon Brodie , a James Cook University water quality expert , who was referring to inaction on the part of the Australian government . “ It ’ s been my life managing water quality , we ’ ve failed . ”\n\nUnfortunately , in this age of global warming , temperatures are expected to continue rising , which means more of these bleaching events will happen , and they will cause even more damage . And the reality is , this could be the last generation who will get to see the grand beauty of this reef .\n\nFortunately , it ’ s not too late for us to save the rest of the planet from the worst effects of climate change .

We have to have the resources to combat the fires , and also have to invest in managing our vegetation and forests and all the ways we dwell in this very wonderful place — but a place that ’ s getting hotter . ”\n\nHowever , climate scientists are more skeptical , noting that climate change could be one of a variety of factors .\n\nA comprehensive look at the question by Southern California Public Radio — hardly a conservative outlet — found that there was considerable debate about the factors that made this year ’ s fires particularly bad .\n\nOne factor was high winds , whose connection to climate change is “ still up for debate. ” Another factor was the state ’ s recent drought , which persisted in the part of Southern California where the Thomas fire — now in excess of 150,000 acres , with only 15 % containment — struck . ( Ironically , last winter ’ s heavy rains caused brush to grow rapidly , giving fires plenty of fuel to burn . )\n\nAn important factor in the fires of the past week was that people are building homes in areas that are naturally prone to wildfires , or where naturally dry conditions mean that the kinds of building materials and vegetation that people prefer to use in cities and suburbs are a fire hazard .\n\nBrown has frequently cited climate change as the cause for natural disasters before , only to be corrected by scientists , who suggested he was guilty of “ noble-cause corruption ” — i.e . distorting science in service of a cause that many scientists support .\n\nLast year , both Brown and then-President Barack Obama falsely linked wildfires across the western United States to climate change . And last month , Brown told a conference at the Vatican that the world needed “ brain washing ” on climate change .\n\nAside from the Thomas fire , firefighters have made significant progress in their struggle against some of the other fires burning across the region . The Skirball fire near the 405 Freeway , which brought traffic to a standstill in Los Angeles on Thursday , was at 75 percent containment as of Saturday afternoon , according to Southern California Public Radio . The Lilac fire , which killed several dozen horses on Thursday , was fully contained by Saturday evening , according to the Register .\n\n“ The Creek Fire was now 80 % contained , and the Rye Fire was 65 % contained ” as of Saturday , the Los Angeles Times reported .\n\nOfficials say there have been no deaths associated with the Southern California fires .", "label": [[1370, 1662, "Intentional"], [698, 751, "Intentional"], [2139, 2152, "Intentional"], [32, 119, "False Causality"], [322, 420, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2076, 2172, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/12/09/jerry-brown-blames-climate-change-california-fires-new-normal/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-california-fires-misleads-omitting-explanation-climates-influence-joel-pollak/"}
{"id": 791, "data": "Global warming has not accelerated temperature rise in the bulk atmosphere in more than two decades , according to a new study funded by the Department of Energy .\n\nUniversity of Alabama-Huntsville climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider found that by removing the climate effects of volcanic eruptions early on in the satellite temperature record it showed virtually no change in the rate of warming since the early 1990s .\n\n“ We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere ’ s sensitivity to CO2 much too high , ” Christy said in a statement . “ This recent paper bolsters that conclusion . ”\n\nChristy and McNider found the rate of warming has been 0.096 degrees Celsius per decade after “ the removal of volcanic cooling in the early part of the record , ” which “ is essentially the same value we determined in 1994 … using only 15 years of data . ”\n\nThe study is sure to be contentious . Christy has argued for years that climate models exaggerate global warming in the bulk atmosphere , which satellites have monitored since the late 1970s .\n\nChristy , a noted skeptic of catastrophic man-made global warming , said his results reinforce his claim that climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere , the lowest five miles of the atmosphere . Models are too sensitive to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere , he said .\n\n“ From our observations we calculated that value as 1.1 C ( almost 2° Fahrenheit ) , while climate models estimate that value as 2.3 C ( about 4.1° F ) , ” Christy said .\n\nWhile many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations , few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves .\n\nA recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot , the “ overestimation ” was “ partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations . ”\n\nChristy ’ s removal of volcanic-driven cooling from satellite temperature data could also draw scrutiny . The study also removed El Nino and La Nina cycles , which are particularly pronounced in satellite records , but those cycles largely canceled each other out , the co-authors said .\n\nChristy said his works shows the “ climate models need to be retooled to better reflect conditions in the actual climate , while policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered . ”\n\nTwo major volcanoes — El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 — caused global average temperature to dip as a result of volcanic ash , soot and debris reflecting sunlight back into space .\n\nThose eruptions meant there was more subsequent warming in the following years , making the rate of warming appear to be rising as a result of man-made emissions or other factors , Christy said .\n\n“ Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period , which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset , which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend , ” Christy said .\n\n“ While volcanic eruptions are natural events , it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend . If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset , they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers , or a long-term cooling , ” Christy said .", "label": [[440, 496, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2794, 2817, "Equivocation"], [1597, 1780, "Logical Fallacy"]], "source_url": "http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/29/study-satellites-show-no-acceleration-in-global-warming-for-23-years/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-caller-uncritically-reports-misleading-satellite-temperature-study-michael-bastasch/"}
{"id": 795, "data": "You couldn ’ t make it up if you tried . Australia is a huge exporter of energy as coal , LNG and uranium , yet it has unreliable and ­expensive electricity . South Australia has achieved a first for ­Australia : it has the most expensive electricity in the world . A short time ago it had cheap coal-fired power .\n\nAustralia remains the only G20 country with no nuclear power yet has 30 per cent of the planet ’ s in-ground uranium , mainly in South Australia . Vic­toria has banned drilling for ­onshore gas in its two gas-rich ­basins yet suffers a gas shortage .\n\nAustralia ’ s energy crisis is based on a flawed fundamental . Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions . It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming . If it were shown , it would also have to be shown that the 97 per cent of emissions from natural processes such as ocean degassing , volcanoes , natural chemical reactions and exhalation don ’ t drive global warming .\n\nIn the geological past , Earth ’ s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes . The past shows that climate change is normal , that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill .\n\nIce core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming , the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide . The zenith of the Little Ice Age was 300 years ago and since then we have slightly warmed and cooled during a long-term warming trend . Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature . On all timescales it can be shown that there is no correlation between CO2 emissions and global warming . Without correlation , there can be no causation .\n\nThe worldwide temperature record has been changed . Cooling trends have been “ homogenised ” to warming trends . In the corporate world , if a loss is “ homo­genised ” to a profit , it is fraud . Why is climate science different ?\n\nNo genuine environmentalist could honestly support subsidised wind turbines that despoil the scenery , slice and dice birds and bats , damage human health and spread toxins . This is not environmentalism . It is power over people by unelected activists , often ­funded from outside Australia .\n\nUnless the laws of physics are changed , solar power can not be made more efficient . Solar facilities result in the clearing and environmental degradation of huge acreages and depositing of toxins .\n\nConstruction and maintenance of wind and solar facilities ­release far more carbon dioxide than they are meant to save over their working lives and they need to be sup­ported 24/7 by coal-fired generators . The Spaniards invented a way of producing solar power at night without changing the laws of physics . Diesel generators with floodlights illuminated solar ­panels . Subsidies were so generous that profits could still be made at night . No wonder Spain went broke .\n\nAustralia ’ s CO2 emissions are only 1.3 per cent of global human emissions , which are 3 per cent of the total global emissions . To reduce Australian emissions will have absolutely no effect on the planet ’ s temperature . The only effect will be a rapid reduction in jobs as electricity prices skyrocket .\n\nThose who signed the Paris ­Accord actually believed they can twiddle the planetary dials to minimise warming to less than 2 Celsius yet seemed blissfully ­unaware that whatever humans do , they can not change Earth ’ s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate . Australia ’ s signed a suicide note yet didn ’ t seem to notice that China , India , Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions .\n\nThe grasslands , crops , forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits . Australia should demand the Paris Accord shell out some of the billions sloshing around in the climate business .\n\nThe subsidies for wind and solar power and the must-take mandate have attracted all sorts of dodgy enterprises , lickspittles and carpetbaggers to the renewable energy honey pot . The National Energy Market was the nail in the coffin and , after 40 years of falling electricity costs and a reliable grid , Australia now has energy poverty and destruction of businesses . Electricity is not a luxury ; it is a necessity for any civilised society .\n\nThe solution requires political courage . Cancel the renewable energy target , large-scale RET , ­renewable energy certificates , clean energy target and any funding that subsidises renewable ­energy . Cancel funding for climate research institutes , climate conferences , carbon capture schemes and jaunts for signing suicide notes .\n\nIf any energy company provides electricity to the grid , decree that it must have 90 per cent availability 24/7 and get rid of the must-take mandate . Cancel the charitable status of feral activist groups like Greenpeace . Change the Corporations Law such that green activists , environmentalists , unionists and lobbyists abide by the same conditions of probity as company directors .\n\nBecause investment confidence in energy in Australia has been destroyed , governments must build modern coal-fired and nuclear power stations . Australia needs a nuclear industry that could start by using modular reactors for isolated mines and towns before growing a vertically integrated nuclear industry .\n\nOnly elections can change the madness but no major political party has nation-building leaders and a coherent policy to cut electricity costs and ­increase reliability . Politicians fiddle around the edges . As soon as the words emissions , climate change and Paris are used , you know you are being conned and that the world ’ s biggest scam will continue .\n\nAustralia ’ s energy policy is based on the fallacious assumption that human emissions of CO2 drive global warming . This underpins the Finkel and Australian Competition and Consumer Com­­mis­sion reports , the Paris ­Accord and political quick-fix ­solutions . Renewable energy has become ruinable energy , thanks to green ideology .\n\nI fear there will be years of ­increasing pain before there is enough political courage to bring Australia to what it had in the past : cheap , reliable employment-generating electricity .\n\nEmeritus Professor Ian Plimer ’ s Climate Delusion and The Great Electricity Rip-off ( Connor Court ) has just been published .\n\n", "label": [[4507, 4548, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [631, 787, "Faulty Generalization"], [631, 787, "Logical Fallacy"], [788, 1005, "Logical Fallacy"], [1007, 1029, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1807, 1856, "Logical Fallacy"], [0, 40, "Intentional"], [1032, 1168, "Equivocation"], [1325, 1806, "Intentional"], [2090, 2117, "Intentional"], [2171, 2262, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2385, 2470, "Intentional"], [1325, 1806, "Logical Fallacy"], [1971, 2053, "Logical Fallacy"], [2265, 2295, "Intentional"], [2296, 2383, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2471, 2584, "Logical Fallacy"], [3029, 3057, "False Causality"], [4152, 4202, "Ad Hominem"], [4239, 4429, "False Causality"], [4430, 4505, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [5748, 5898, "Intentional"], [5748, 5898, "Ad Hominem"], [6346, 6369, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [631, 700, "Intentional"], [702, 785, "Intentional"], [1032, 1168, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1032, 1168, "Intentional"], [1171, 1323, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1171, 1323, "Intentional"], [1635, 1698, "Intentional"], [1749, 1804, "Intentional"], [1807, 1855, "Intentional"], [220, 264, "Intentional"], [2586, 2792, "Intentional"], [3721, 3823, "Intentional"], [5940, 6014, "Intentional"], [3825, 3943, "Intentional"], [1910, 1969, "Intentional"], [2090, 2265, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [5748, 5898, "Ad Hominem"], [2385, 2469, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"]], "source_url": "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/misguided-renewable-energy-policies-will-ruin-the-nation/news-story/1f0ad93fa98a37fbf6ddd6c8eb425231", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/commentary-australian-ignores-evidence-misrepresents-research-falsely-claiming-humans-not-responsible-climate-change-ian-plimer/"}

This represents an increase in acidity of about 26 % .\n\nThe study 's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel .\n\nHe is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification .\n\nHe told BBC News : `` Acidification affects marine life across all groups , although to different degrees .\n\n`` Warm-water corals are generally more sensitive than cold-water corals . Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans .\n\n`` And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms .\n\n`` But even if an organism is n't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web .\n\n`` At the end of the day , these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us . ''\n\nOn the agenda\nSince 2009 , scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages ; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web ; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation .\n\nSome research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea , the Baltic , the Arctic , and Papua New Guinea .\n\nA synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month 's summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations .\n\nEarly life stages were affected in Atlantic cod , blue mussels , starfish , sea urchins and sea butterflies .\n\nBut an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification . And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit .\n\nDr Carol Turley , an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important .\n\nShe told BBC News : `` It 's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish .\n\n`` It 's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society .\n\n`` On the lead-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored .

{"id": 797, "data": "Part 1 . What is happening ?\n1 .\nClimate change ? Global warming ? What do we call it ?\nBoth are accurate , but they mean different things .\n\nYou can think of global warming as one type of climate change . The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures , such as shifting rainfall patterns .\n\nPresident Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because “ the weather has been so cold ” in winter . But the claim is false . Scientists have used both terms for decades .\n\n2 .\nHow much is the Earth heating up ?\nTwo degrees is more significant than it sounds .\n\nAs of early 2017 , the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit ( more than 1 degree Celsius ) since 1880 , when records began at a global scale . The number may sound low , but as an average over the surface of an entire planet , it is actually high , which explains why much of the world ’ s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace . If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked , scientists say , the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit , which would undermine the planet ’ s capacity to support a large human population .\n\n3 .\nWhat is the greenhouse effect , and\nhow does it cause global warming ?\nWe ’ ve known about it for more than a century . Really .\n\nIn the 19th century , scientists discovered that certain gases in the air trap and slow down heat that would otherwise escape to space . Carbon dioxide is a major player ; without any of it in the air , the Earth would be a frozen wasteland . The first prediction that the planet would warm as humans released more of the gas was made in 1896 . The gas has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far , and the Earth has warmed by roughly the amount that scientists predicted it would .\n\nInterested in keeping up with climate change ?\nSign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world .\n\n4 .\nHow do we know humans are responsible\nfor the increase in carbon dioxide ?\nThis one is nailed down .\n\nHard evidence , including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions , shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity . Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past , but those changes took thousands of years . Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done .\n\n5 .\nCould natural factors be the cause of the warming ?\nNope .\n\nIn theory , they could be . If the sun were to start putting out more radiation , for instance , that would definitely warm the Earth . But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough . The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale , and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases .\n\n6 .\nWhy do people deny the science of climate change ?\nMostly because of ideology .\n\nInstead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented , some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science .\n\nPresident Trump has sometimes claimed that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public , or that global warming was invented by China to disable American industry . The climate denialists ’ arguments have become so strained that even oil and coal companies have distanced themselves publicly , though some still help to finance the campaigns of politicians who espouse such views .\n\nPart 2 . What could happen ?\n1 .\nHow much trouble are we in ?\nBig trouble .\n\nOver the coming 25 or 30 years , scientists say , the climate is likely to gradually warm , with more extreme weather . Coral reefs and other sensitive habitats are already starting to die . Longer term , if emissions rise unchecked , scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments , produce waves of refugees , precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth ’ s history , and melt the polar ice caps , causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world ’ s coastal cities . The emissions that create those risks are happening now , raising deep moral questions for our generation .\n\n2 .\nHow much should I worry about\nclimate change affecting me directly ?\nAre you rich enough to shield your descendants ?\n\nThe simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects , whether they know it or not . Because of sea level rise , for instance , some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate , scientists have calculated . Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming . The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change . Of course , as with almost all other social problems , poor people will be hit first and hardest .\n\n3 .\nHow much will the seas rise ?\nThe real question is how fast .\n\nThe ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century , forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion . But if that rate continued , it would probably be manageable , experts say .\n\nThe risk is that the rate will increase still more . Scientists who study the Earth ’ s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario , though that looks unlikely . Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow , 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable , enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them . How long it will take is unclear . But if emissions continue apace , the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet .\n\n4 .\nIs recent crazy weather tied to climate change ?\nSome of it is .\n\nScientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense . It is also causing heavier rainstorms , and coastal flooding is getting worse as the oceans rise because of human emissions . Global warming has intensified droughts in regions like the Middle East , and it may have strengthened a recent drought in California .\n\nIn many other cases , though — hurricanes , for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed . Scientists are gradually improving their understanding as computer analyses of the climate grow more powerful .\n\nPart 3 . What can we do ?\n1 .\nAre there any realistic solutions to the problem ?\nYes , but change is happening too slowly .\n\nSociety has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe , scientists say . But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground , it is not too late to act . The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero . The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars , stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants . But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change .\n\n2 .\nWhat is the Paris Agreement ?\nVirtually every country agreed to limit future emissions .\n\nThe landmark deal was reached outside Paris in December 2015 . The reductions are voluntary and the pledges do not do enough to head off severe effects . But the agreement is supposed to be reviewed every few years so that countries ramp up their commitments . President Trump announced in 2017 that he would pull the United States out of the deal , though that will take years , and other countries have said they would go forward regardless of American intentions .\n\n3 .\nDoes clean energy help or hurt the economy ?\nJob growth in renewable energy is strong .\n\nThe energy sources with the lowest emissions include wind turbines , solar panels , hydroelectric dams and nuclear power stations . Power plants burning natural gas also produce fewer emissions than those burning coal . Converting to these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short term , but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air . And expansion of the market is driving down the costs of renewable energy so fast that it may ultimately beat dirty energy on price alone — it already does in some areas .\n\nThe transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers , like coal companies , but it also creates jobs . The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining .\n\n4 .\nWhat about fracking or ‘ clean coal ’ ?\nBoth could help clean up the energy system .\n\nHydraulic fracturing , or “ fracking , ” is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries . Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run , though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run . The fracking itself can also create local pollution .\n\n“ Clean coal ” is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground . It has yet to be proven to work economically , but some experts think it could eventually play a major role .\n\n5 .\nWhat ’ s the latest with electric cars ?\nSales are still small overall , but they are rising fast .\n\nThe cars draw power at night from the electric grid and give off no pollution during the day as they move around town . They are inherently more efficient than gasoline cars and would represent an advance even if the power were generated by burning coal , but they will be far more important as the electric grid itself becomes greener through renewable power . The cars are improving so fast that some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030 .\n\n6 .\nWhat are carbon taxes , carbon\ntrading and carbon offsets ?\nIt ’ s just jargon for putting a price on pollution .\n\nThe greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called “ carbon emissions ” for short . That is because two of the most important gases , carbon dioxide and methane , contain carbon . ( Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category , even if they do not actually contain carbon . ) When you hear about carbon taxes , carbon trading and so on , these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions , which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them .\n\n7 .\nClimate change seems so overwhelming .\nWhat can I personally do about it ?\nStart by sharing this with 50 of your friends .\n\nExperts say the problem can only be solved by large-scale , collective action . Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems , using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can . So the most important thing you can do is to exercise your rights as a citizen , speaking up and demanding change .\n\nYou can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money . You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power , install a smart thermostat , switch to more efficient light bulbs , turn off unused lights , drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit , waste less food , and eat less meat .\n\nTaking one or two fewer plane rides per year can save as much in emissions as all the other actions combined . If you want to be at the cutting edge , you can look at buying an electric or hybrid car or putting solar panels on your roof . If your state has a competitive electricity market , you may be able to buy 100 percent green power .\n\nLeading corporations , including large manufacturers like carmakers , are starting to demand clean energy for their operations . You can pay attention to company policies , support the companies taking the lead , and let the others know you expect them to do better .\n\nThese personal steps may be small in the scheme of things , but they can raise your own consciousness about the problem — and the awareness of the people around you . In fact , discussing this issue with your friends and family is one of the most meaningful things you can do .", "label": [[338, 476, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [338, 474, "Intentional"], [3338, 3399, "Ad Hominem"], [3410, 3475, "Ad Hominem"], [3410, 3475, "Intentional"], [3088, 3293, "Circular Reasoning"], [3758, 3771, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4866, 4956, "Logical Fallacy"], [3964, 4429, "Faulty Generalization"], [4019, 4023, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/climate/what-is-climate-change.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-straightforward-answers-common-climate-questions-accurate-justin-gillis/"}
{"id": 801, "data": "YUKON DELTA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE , Alaska — The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as other parts of the planet , and even here in sub-Arctic Alaska the rate of warming is high . Sea ice and wildlife habitat are disappearing ; higher sea levels threaten coastal native villages .\n\nBut to the scientists from Woods Hole Research Center who have come here to study the effects of climate change , the most urgent is the fate of permafrost , the always-frozen ground that underlies much of the state .\n\nStarting just a few feet below the surface and extending tens or even hundreds of feet down , it contains vast amounts of carbon in organic matter — plants that took carbon dioxide from the atmosphere centuries ago , died and froze before they could decompose . Worldwide , permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere .\n\nOnce this ancient organic material thaws , microbes convert some of it to carbon dioxide and methane , which can flow into the atmosphere and cause even more warming . Scientists have estimated that the process of permafrost thawing could contribute as much as 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit to global warming over the next several centuries , independent of what society does to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities .\n\nIn Alaska , nowhere is permafrost more vulnerable than here , 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle , in a vast , largely treeless landscape formed from sediment brought down by two of the state ’ s biggest rivers , the Yukon and the Kuskokwim . Temperatures three feet down into the frozen ground are less than half a degree below freezing . This area could lose much of its permafrost by midcentury .\n\nThat , said Max Holmes , senior scientist and deputy director of the research center , “ has all kinds of consequences both locally for this region , for the animals and the people who live here , as well as globally . ”\n\n“ It ’ s sobering to think of this magnificent landscape and how fundamentally it can change over a relatively short time period , ” he added .\n\nBut on this wide , flat tundra , it takes a practiced eye to see how Alaska is thawing from below .\n\nAt one of the countless small lakes that pepper the region , chunks of shoreline that include what had been permafrost have calved off toward the water .\n\nNearby , across a spongy bed of mosses and lichens , a small boggy depression most likely formed when the ice in the top layers of the permafrost below it melted to water .\n\nIn July , the Woods Hole scientists , along with 13 undergraduate and graduate students working on projects of their own , set up a temporary field station on a nameless lake 60 miles northwest of Bethel , which with a population of 6,000 is the largest town in the region . They drilled permafrost cores with a power auger , took other sediment and water samples and embedded temperature probes in the frozen ground . Later , back in the lab at Woods Hole , they began the process of analyzing the samples for carbon content and nutrients .\n\nThe goal is to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and , ultimately , how much and what mix of greenhouse gases is released .\n\n“ In order to know how much is lost , you have to know how much is there , ” said Sue Natali , a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert .\n\nEven in colder northern Alaska , where permafrost in some parts of the North Slope extends more than 2,100 feet below the surface , scientists are seeing stark changes . Vladimir E. Romanovsky , a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , said that temperatures at a depth of 65 feet have risen by 3 degrees Celsius ( about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit ) over decades .\n\nNear-surface changes have been even greater . At one northern site , he said , permafrost temperatures at shallow depths have climbed from minus 8 degrees Celsius to minus 3 .\n\n“ Minus 3 is not that far from zero , ” Dr. Romanovsky said . If emissions and warming continue at the same rate , he said , near-surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century .\n\nThere is plenty of debate among scientists about when and how much of Alaska ’ s permafrost will thaw . And there is no doubt that thawing of the full depth of permafrost would take millenniums .\n\nBut Dr. Romanovsky said that his and others ’ work shows that permafrost “ is not as stable as people thought . ”\n\nIn addition to greenhouse gas emissions , thawing wreaks havoc on infrastructure , causing slumping of land when ice loses volume as it turns to water .\n\nThe main road in Bethel , where average temperatures have risen about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-20th century , is more of a washboard than a thoroughfare because of shifting ground . Building foundations in Bethel move and crack as well . Some roads , airport runways and parking areas have to be reinforced with liquid-filled pipes that transfer heat out of the permafrost to keep the ground from slumping .\n\nThe thawing of permafrost is a gradual process . Ground is fully frozen in winter , and begins to thaw from the top down as air temperatures rise in spring . As average temperatures increase over years , this thawed , or active , layer can increase in depth .\n\nAt the field station , the researchers are especially interested in how wildfires affect the permafrost . Because burning removes some of the vegetation that acts as insulation , the theory is that burning should cause permafrost to thaw more .\n\nParts of the tundra here burned in the 1970s and in the summer of 2015 , so the researchers took cores from both burned and unburned areas . Scientists wrestled with the bulky power auger as its stainless steel tube worked its way into the hard permafrost . Cores — often containing thin layers of solid ice — were labeled , packed in a cooler and sent by helicopter to a freezer in Bethel .\n\nThawing permafrost underneath or at the edge of a lake can cause it to drain like a leaky bathtub . Thawing elsewhere can bring about small elevation changes that can in turn lead to changes in water flow through the landscape , drying out some parts of the tundra and turning others into bogs .\n\nBeyond the local effects on plant and animal life , the landscape changes can have an important climate change impact , by altering the mix of carbon dioxide and methane that is emitted . Although methane does not persist in the atmosphere for as long as carbon dioxide , it has a far greater heat-trapping ability and can contribute to more rapid warming .\n\nSo the researchers devote much of their time to studying the flow of water and the carbon and nutrients it contains .\n\n“ It ’ s one of the big questions to tackle – what ’ s wet and dry now , and what will be wet and dry in the future , ” Dr. Natali said . If the decomposing permafrost is wet , there will be less oxygen available to the microbes , so they will produce more methane . If the permafrost is dry , the decomposition will lead to more carbon dioxide .\n\nEstimates vary on how much carbon is currently released from thawing permafrost worldwide , but by one calculation emissions over the rest of the century could average about 1.5 billion tons a year , or about the same as current annual emissions from fossil-fuel burning in the United States .\n\nAlready , thawing permafrost and warmer temperatures are being blamed for rising carbon emissions in the Alaskan tundra , both here and farther north . In a study earlier this year , researchers found that bacterial decomposition of thawed permafrost , as well as carbon dioxide produced by living vegetation , continues later into the fall because freezing of the surface is delayed .\n\nThe rise in emissions has been so significant , the researchers found , that Alaska may be shifting from a sink , or storehouse , of carbon , to a net source .\n\nDr. Holmes said that shift was not surprising given the climate trend , and he would expect that sub-Arctic parts of Siberia , Canada and other areas with permafrost may be undergoing similar changes .\n\n“ There ’ s a massive amount of carbon that ’ s in the ground , that ’ s built up slowly over thousands and thousands of years , ” he said .\n\n“ It ’ s been in a freezer , and that freezer is now turning into a refrigerator . ”", "label": [[1944, 1998, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [7137, 7155, "Intentional"], [4495, 4507, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/23/climate/alaska-permafrost-thawing.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-accurately-assesses-the-state-of-alaskan-permafrost-henry-fountain/"}
{"id": 802, "data": "Scientists have long known about the anomalous `` warming hole '' in the North Atlantic Ocean , an area immune to warming of Earth 's oceans . This cool zone in the North Atlantic Ocean appears to be associated with a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) , one of the key drivers in global ocean circulation .\n\nA recent study published in Nature outlines research by a team of Yale University and University of Southhampton scientists . The team found evidence that Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet 's largest ocean circulation system . While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world , we will be largely in uncharted territory .\n\nAMOC is one of the largest current systems in the Atlantic Ocean and the world . Generally speaking , it transports warm and salty water northward from the tropics to South and East of Greenland . This warm water cools to ambient water temperature then sinks as it is saltier and thus denser than the relatively more fresh surrounding water . The dense mass of water sinks to the base of the North Atlantic Ocean and is pushed south along the abyss of the Atlantic Ocean .\n\nThis process whereby water is transported into the Northern Atlantic Ocean acts to distribute ocean water globally . What 's more important , and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes . The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere , playing a key role in warming of western Europe . You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC , the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe .\n\nEvidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation . Hence , a slowdown in the planet 's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes . The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland . This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic , inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters . This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north .\n\nMelting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades . Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30 % less today than it was in 1979 . This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing . Hence , indications are that we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system .\n\nThis scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie `` The Day After Tomorrow . '' As a disclaimer , the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales .\n\nWhile geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today , scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead .", "label": [[2915, 2975, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/08/03/global-ocean-circulation-appears-to-be-collapsing-due-to-a-warming-planet/#8a42b28f6f40", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/forbes-article-accurately-describes-research-atlantic-ocean-circulation-weakening-headline-goes-farther-trevor-nace/"}
{"id": 803, "data": "Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal : If global warming is “ real , ”\nboth sides of the debate seem to assume , the climate lobby ’ s policy agenda follows\ninexorably .\nIt does not . Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively\nanalyzing economic costs and the actual , rather than symbolic , benefits of their policies .\nSkeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis .\nTo arrive at a wise policy response , we first need to consider how much economic\ndamage climate change will do . Current models struggle to come up with economic costs\ncommensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric . Typical costs are well below 10 % of\ngross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond .\nThat ’ s a lot of money—but it ’ s a lot of years , too . Even 10 % less GDP in 100 years\ncorresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth . Climate change therefore\ndoes not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth . If the goal is\n10 % more GDP in 100 years , pro-growth tax , regulatory and entitlement reforms would\nbe far more effective .\nYes , the costs are not evenly spread . Some places will do better and some will do worse .\nThe American South might be a worse place to grow wheat ; Southern Canada might be a\nbetter one . In a century , Miami might find itself in approximately the same situation as\nthe Dutch city of Rotterdam today .\nBut spread over a century , the costs of moving and adapting are not as imposing as they\nseem . Rotterdam ’ s dikes are expensive , but not prohibitively so . Most buildings are\nrebuilt about every 50 years . If we simply stopped building in flood-prone areas and\nstarted building on higher ground , even the costs of moving cities would be bearable .\nMigration is costly . But much of the world ’ s population moved from farms to cities in\nthe 20th century . Allowing people to move to better climates in the 21st will be equally\npossible . Such investments in climate adaptation are small compared with the\ninvestments we will regularly make in houses , businesses , infrastructure and education .\nAnd economics is the central question—unlike with other environmental problems such\nas chemical pollution . Carbon dioxide hurts nobody ’ s health . It ’ s good for plants .\nClimate change need not endanger anyone . If it did—and you do hear such claims—then\nliving in hot Arizona rather than cool Maine , or living with Louisiana ’ s frequent floods ,\nwould be considered a health catastrophe today .\nGlobal warming is not the only risk our society faces . Even if science tells us that climate\nchange is real and man-made , it does not tell us , as President Obama asserted , that\nclimate change is the greatest threat to humanity . Really ? Greater than nuclear\nexplosions , a world war , global pandemics , crop failures and civil chaos ?\nNo . Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow , widely predicted , relatively small\neconomic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis . Societies do fall apart\nfrom war , disease or chaos . Climate policy must compete with other long-term threats\nfor always-scarce resources .\nFacing this reality , some advocate that we buy some “ insurance. ” Sure , they argue , the\nprojected economic cost seems small , but it could turn out to be a lot worse . But the\nsame argument applies to any possible risk . If you buy overpriced insurance against\nevery potential danger , you soon run out of money . You can sensibly insure only when\nthe premium is in line with the risk—which brings us back where we started , to the need\nfor quantifying probabilities , costs , benefits and alternatives . And uncertainty goes both\nways . Nobody forecast fracking , or that it would make the U.S. the world ’ s carbonreduction leader . Strategic waiting is a rational response to a slow-moving uncertain\nperil with fast-changing technology .\nGlobal warming is not even the obvious top environmental threat . Dirty water , dirty air\nand insect-borne diseases are a far greater problem today for most people world-wide .\nHabitat loss and human predation are a far greater problem for most animals . Elephants\nwon ’ t make it to see a warmer climate . Ask them how they would prefer to spend $ 1\ntrillion—subsidizing high-speed trains or a human-free park the size of Montana .\nThen , we need to know what effect proposed policies have and at what cost . Scientific ,\nquantifiable or even vaguely plausible cause-and-effect thinking are missing from much\nadvocacy for policies to reduce carbon emissions . The Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change ’ s “ scientific ” recommendations , for example , include “ reduced gender\ninequality & marginalization in other forms , ” “ provisioning of adequate housing , ” “ cash\ntransfers ” and “ awareness raising & integrating into education. ” Even if some of these\nare worthy goals , they are not scientifically valid , cost-benefit-tested policies to cool the\nplanet .\nClimate policy advocates ’ apocalyptic vision demands serious analysis , and mushy\nthinking undermines their case . If carbon emissions pose the greatest threat to\nhumanity , it follows that the costs of nuclear power—waste disposal and the occasional\nmeltdown—might be bearable . It follows that the costs of genetically modified foods and\nmodern pesticides , which can feed us with less land and lower carbon emissions , might\nbe bearable . It follows that if the future of civilization is really at stake , adaptation or\ngeo-engineering should not be unmentionable . And it follows that symbolic , ineffective ,\npolitical grab-bag policies should be intolerable .\nMr. Henderson is a research fellow with the Hoover Institution and an economics\nprofessor at the Naval Postgraduate School .

{"id": 807, "data": "Climate change will aggravate economic inequality in the United States , essentially transferring wealth from poor counties in the Southeast and the Midwest to well-off communities in the Northeast and on the coasts , according to the most detailed economic assessment of the phenomenon ever conducted .\n\nThe study , published Thursday in Science , simulates the costs of global warming in excruciating detail , modeling every day of weather in every U.S. county during the 21st century . It finds enormous disparities in how rising temperatures will affect American communities : Texas , Florida , and the Deep South will bleed income in the broiling heat , while some chillier northern states gain moderate benefits .\n\n“ We are really sure the South is going to get hammered , ” says Solomon Hsiang , one of the authors of the paper and a professor of public policy at the University of California , Berkeley . “ The South is really , really negatively affected by climate change , much more so than the North . That wasn ’ t something we were expecting going in . ”\n\nOverall , the paper finds that climate change will cost the United States 1.2 percent of its GDP for every additional degree Celsius of warming , though that figure is somewhat uncertain . If global temperatures rise by four degrees Celsius by 2100—which is very roughly where the current terms of the Paris Agreement would put the planet—U.S . GDP could shrink anywhere between 1.6 and 5.6 percent .\n\nYet beyond its initial findings , the paper represents a major breakthrough for the field of climate economics . Previously , the best financial forecasts of climate change approximated damages for the entire country at once . This new study worked from the bottom up , building its model from dozens of microeconomic studies into how climate change is already affecting regional economies across the United States . Every algorithm in the model emerges from a previously observed relationship in real-world data .\n\n“ This is like the adults entering the room . Economists have , for a quarter century , insisted that more work needs to be done to estimate climate damages . This team has done so , ” said Gernot Wagner , a researcher Harvard University and the former lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund , in an email . He was not connected to the study .\n\nBut this emphasis on the observed means that the research omitted many serious risks of climate change—even those the researchers considered important—if the data describing them was too paltry . The estimates do not include “ non-market goods ” like the loss of biodiversity or natural splendor . In other words : Most people agree that dead polar bears have an economic cost , but there ’ s no consensus on how to approximate it .\n\nThe study also doesn ’ t account for the increased likelihood of “ tail risks ” —that is , unlikely events with catastrophic consequences . Many researchers believe that global warming will make social strife , mass migration , or global military calamity more likely , but those events are , by definition , hard to predict . The same goes for economic disaster prompted by the onset of a “ mega-drought ” or the rapid collapse of the Greenland ice sheet .\n\n“ When we had the Dust Bowl , we saw everyone clear out of the Midwest and flood labor markets in the urban centers on the coast , ” said Hsiang . Nothing like this kind of internal migration is modeled in the Science study .\n\nAll in all , the study ’ s assessments should be interpreted as the most rigorous attempt ever to describe what global warming will cost the United States in a “ normal ” world . It describes an America that has retained a well-organized economy , held together as a political community , and benefitted from the ongoing general global peace that began 70 years ago .\n\nEven in that harmonious world , climate change will make the United States pay .\n\nWhat Climate Change Will Cost Every U.S. County , 2080–2099Across the country ’ s southern half—and especially in states that border the Gulf of Mexico—climate change could impose the equivalent of a 20-percent tax on county-level income , according to the study . Harvests will dwindle , summer energy costs will soar , rising seas will erase real-estate holdings , and heatwaves will set off epidemics of cardiac and pulmonary disease .\n\nThe loss of human life dwarfs all the other economic costs of climate change . Almost every county between El Paso , Texas , and Charlotte , North Carolina , could see their mortality rate rise by more than 20 people out of every 100,000 . By comparison , car accidents killed about 11 Americans out of every 100,000 in 2015 .\n\nBut in the South and Southwest , other damages stack up . Some counties in eastern Texas could see agricultural yields fall by more than 50 percent . West Texas and Arizona may see energy costs rise by 20 percent .\n\nHow Climate Change Will Change Agriculture and Public Health by 2080\n\nSimultaneously , the study finds that some regions may reap moderate economic benefits from global warming . New England , the Pacific Northwest , and the Great Lake states may all prosper as growing seasons lengthen , and the number of frigid , deadly winter days decrease . In the most optimistic scenarios , some counties could see their incomes rise by 10 percent by the middle of the century .\n\nThis may make some Americans scratch their heads . The high costs of climate change will fall on many of the places where people today seem least worried about the phenomenon .\n\n“ Most of the risk maps show that climate change is going to be terrible for Trump country . Like , it ’ s not clear at all—from these maps—why reducing climate change is not a more urgent issue for Republicans , purely as a matter of representing their people , ” said Joseph Majkut , the director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center , a libertarian think tank , in an email . He was not connected to the study .\n\nHsiang explained the disparity as a consequence of the hot places getting hotter . “ If you ’ re in a hot location already , then increasing the temperature tends to be much more damaging than if you ’ re somewhere that is cooler . Moving from 70 to 75 [ degrees Fahrenheit ] is not as big a deal as going from 90 to 95 , ” he told me . “ The South , today , is already very hot . So as the country warms up , the South is disproportionately bearing the burden . ”\n\nIn fact , the only factor of climate change that doesn ’ t specifically hurt the South is a projected rise in property crime associated with climate change . The incidence of nonviolent property crime doesn ’ t rise on summer days , but it tends to fall on the coldest days . “ It ’ s hard to burgle houses or steal cars when there ’ s a lot of snow on the ground , ” said Hsiang , laughing .\n\nAs the North ’ s winters get less icy , the region will see property-crime rates increase . But scorching summer days won ’ t alter the South ’ s crime rates . This is , however , a very small factor , Hsiang cautioned .\n\nHe also warned that the paper ’ s economic projections end in 2099 . If climate change continues unabated into the 22nd century , the North will likely eventually “ flip over ” into much higher temperatures and more severe economic damages , Hsiang said .\n\nThe Science paper is the first product of the Climate Impact Lab , a 25-person consortium of economists and policy experts led by researchers from the University of California , the University of Chicago , Rutgers University , and the Rhodium Group . This study is the first part of their new global assessment of the economic costs of human-caused climate change .\n\n“ What has happened over the last 10 years is there ’ s been a revolution in our ability to measure the relationship between the climate and the economy , partly out of new , real-world data , ” Hsiang told me . “ This paper somewhat came out of the realization that all that new research wasn ’ t going anywhere . It wasn ’ t informing how we think about climate and the economy because those older models weren ’ t built in a way to absorb new findings . ”\n\nTheir new program is called SEAGLAS . It ’ s designed to integrate new research into the regional and local effects of policy into a larger , holistic view of a certain country or part of the world . So while this study focused on U.S. county-level data about crime , human health , agriculture , labor supply , and energy demand , the researchers intend to fold new sectors and data sources into it in the future .\n\n“ It ’ s a great development , and the future of climate economics , ” said Majkut . “ This new study puts us on much more satisfying empirical ground as we consider the relationships between climate change and economic output . For that alone it should be praised . ”\n\nHe did question one of the assumptions underlying the project : whether previously observed relationships will continue to hold in a future world . “ If the high rates of human mortality can be eliminated or reduced with adaptation ( more air conditioning , sports gels , better medicine , or people moving out of the South ) then the economic picture really changes and the costs of climate will be reduced dramatically , ” he said .\n\nFor that reason , Majkut said , “ the research has a long way to go before it approaches anything like a comprehensive estimate of climate risk . Meanwhile , we emit . ”\n\n“ SEAGLAS provides a terrific framework to build upon , ” said Wagner in an email . “ We ’ ve always known that there are enormous regional disparities across the globe . The fact that damages vary so much within a rich country like the U.S. is striking . ”\n\nSo if climate modeling remains imperfect , what ’ s the point of doing it ? Researchers have spent the last 25 years trying to forecast the economic damages of climate change . Eventually , they hope to arrive at the social cost of carbon—the damage to the economy dealt by every additional ton of carbon dioxide—which would inform the creation of a carbon tax . Yet across all those years , political opposition to a carbon tax has only hardened , and the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has only gone up .\n\nHsiang said that precision is still important . “ If we have a rough number , is that good enough ? ” he asked . “ I definitely think we ’ re never going to know the cost of climate change to seven decimal places . But it ’ s unclear what a rough number means , because there ’ s been very little benchmarking to any real-world data. ” ( An additional paper in this edition of Science clarifies that , so far , SEAGLAS has produced social costs of carbon that are fairly similar to two of the three most-famous economic climate models . )\n\n“ To be honest , transforming the global energy system is not a cheap task . It ’ s not a small thing , ” Hsiang said . “ And in some places , a lot of the concerns about implementing policy are related to concerns about the reliability of the numbers being used . It ’ s a little like the doctor coming in and saying you ’ re sick and he has some medicine which might work . You ’ ll feel much more comfortable about the medicine if you know there ’ s been clinical research and systematic control trials demonstrating it works . ”", "label": [[5936, 5969, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/global-warming-american-south/532200/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-atlantic-accurately-reports-study-economic-impacts-continued-climate-change-us-robinson-meyer/"}
{"id": 808, "data": "Extremely hot days , when temperatures soar to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher , can be miserable . Crops wilt in the fields . Electric grids strain to keep pace with demand . People are at greater risk of dying . And those hot temperatures are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades .\n\nThe map above , based on a new analysis from the Climate Impact Lab , shows how 95-degree days ( 35 degrees Celsius ) are expected to multiply this century if countries take moderate climate action . In this scenario , countries would take some measures , but not drastic ones , to curb emissions — roughly the trajectory of the current pledges under the Paris climate agreement .\n\nThe resulting global warming would still cause significant shifts for many cities . In Washington , from 1986 to 2005 , an average of seven days each year had temperatures of at least 95 degrees . By the end of the century , the city can expect 29 of these extremely hot days per year , on average . ( The likely range is 14 to 46 hot days per year . )\n\nPhoenix is used to the heat , averaging 124 days per year with 95-degree weather . At the end of the century , that ’ s expected to increase to around 155 days — an extra month of extreme temperatures each year . Madrid would go from eight severely hot days per year to 43 , Beijing from nine to 35 .\n\nThe swings are even greater closer to the equator . New Delhi , India ’ s capital city , has historically averaged 105 days with temperatures of at least 95 degrees each year . That ’ s likely to rise to a range of 137 to 200 days per year .\n\nThings could get worse if countries fail to take action\nIf the world ’ s nations took no action on global warming , and emissions continued to rise at the same pace they did in the first decade of this century — with total global warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century — extremely hot days would become much more commonplace .\n\nGlobal warming if no action is taken\n\nBy 2100 , Washington could swelter in 95-degree weather for fully one-fifth of the year — around 74 days , on average . Large swaths of Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa would experience these temperatures for most of the year .\n\nThis worst case for global warming now appears less likely as global coal use declines and nations slowly move toward cleaner energy .\n\nHow 95-degree days disrupt our everyday lives\nIn the United States , electricity use soars as temperatures rise and more households use air-conditioning more frequently . One recent study found that the United States ’ electric grid would have to handle a 7.2 percent increase in peak demand this century under a moderate warming scenario .\n\nAs temperature increases :\n\nThe flip side is that air-conditioning can be an essential adaptation tactic . In countries without widespread cooling , heat deaths rise more sharply during the hottest days . One study estimated that heat deaths in India increase by 3.2 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above 68 ( or every 1 degree Celsius above 20 ) . Energy use in many countries may rise sharply as people struggle to adapt to a hotter climate .\n\nOther scientists have found that corn and soybean yields in the United States plummet precipitously when temperatures rise above 84 degrees Fahrenheit ( 29 degrees Celsius ) , and that worker productivity declines sharply , particularly for outdoor jobs . And researchers are trying to understand how crime and conflict might rise as temperatures increase .\n\nUltimately , people will be better able to adapt if they have a better idea of what individual cities and regions can expect , said Trevor Houser , who co-directs the Climate Impact Lab . In the United States , some urban planners are already experimenting with techniques like adding green spaces or increasing the reflectivity of rooftops to cool down city centers during heat waves .\n\n“ Right now , when you start talking to people about higher temperatures , they tend to think , great , more beach days , ” said Solomon Hsiang , a professor of public policy at the University of California , Berkeley who helps direct the lab . “ What ’ s often less appreciated is just how much an extremely hot day can distort our lives in all sorts of ways we don ’ t often even think about . ”", "label": [[88, 97, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1980, 2099, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/22/climate/95-degree-day-maps.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-story-highlights-the-growing-number-of-extremely-hot-days-in-a-warming-world-brad-plumer-n-popovich/"}

Pretty much everyone , alarmists and skeptics alike , is agreed on that .\n\nRather , they mean “ global warming ” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists , and huxter politicians , and scaremongering green activists , and brainwashed mainstream media ( MSM ) environmental correspondents . “ Global warming ” as in the scary , historically unprecedented , primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown .\n\nWhat all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming ( CAGW ) — is a fake artefact .\n\nThat is , all these different experts from around the world — China , Russia , Canada , the U.S. , Italy , etc . — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable , peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story .\n\nLate 20th century and early 21st century global warming , they show , is neither dramatic , nor unusual , nor scary .\n\nHere , as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone , are just some of the charts to prove it .\n\nBüntgen et al , below , shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today\n\nAbrantes et al ( below ) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era .\n\nHere ’ s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago\n\nHere ’ s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there ’ s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries :\n\nAnd on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all , each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn ’ t support its being unusual or a problem .

This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology , quasi-religious hysteria , and “ follow the money ” corruption , never about “ science . ”\n\nStill , it ’ s always a comfort to know that “ the science ” is on our side too .\n\nThey do so hate that fact , the Greenies .", "label": [[3695, 3805, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1594, 1626, "Intentional"], [1915, 2005, "Intentional"], [2278, 2315, "Intentional"], [2147, 2236, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2278, 2315, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [363, 410, "Intentional"], [2147, 2236, "Intentional"], [2376, 2461, "Intentional"], [1915, 2005, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2376, 2463, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [31, 105, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [690, 850, "Ad Hominem"], [363, 409, "Equivocation"], [853, 1092, "Intentional"], [1195, 1249, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1626, 1656, "Equivocation"], [38, 87, "Intentional"], [1967, 1985, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2147, 2234, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2300, 2315, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2440, 2461, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2518, 2688, "Logical Fallacy"], [2787, 2875, "Intentional"], [2748, 2755, "Equivocation"], [2881, 2949, "Ad Hominem"], [3308, 3323, "Ad Hominem"], [3346, 3366, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3336, 3342, "Ad Populum"], [3410, 3577, "Logical Fallacy"], [3695, 3778, "Ad Hominem"]], "source_url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/06/delingpole-global-warming-is-myth-58-scientific-papers-2017/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-misrepresents-research-58-scientific-papers-falsely-claim-disprove-human-caused-global-warming-james-delingpole/"}
{"id": 813, "data": "The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule , a new study finds .\n\nSince CO2 is the primary heat-trapping greenhouse gas — and since the permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does today — this means a vicious cycle has begun that will speed up global warming .\n\n“ Because it ’ s getting warmer , there ’ s more CO2 coming out which means it ’ s going to get warmer which means there ’ s more CO2 coming out , ” explained Harvard researcher and lead author Roisin Commane . Dr. Commane told ThinkProgress that “ warming soils will emit more CO2 and this will overwhelm any CO2 uptake ” due to an increase in plantlife from “ CO2 fertilization and warmer temperatures . ” ’\n\nThe study is the first to report that a major portion of the Arctic is a net source of heat-trapping emissions . As a result , Commane warns that our current climate models need to be updated : “ We ’ re seeing this much earlier than we thought we would see it . ”\n\n“ We find that Alaska , overall , was a net source of carbon to the atmosphere during 2012–2014 , ” the study concludes . Data from NOAA ’ s Barrow Alaska station “ indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975 , supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2 . ”\n\nThe permafrost , or tundra , has been a very large carbon freezer . For a very long time , it has had a very low decomposition rate for the carbon-rich plant matter . But we ’ ve been leaving the freezer door wide open and are witnessing the permafrost being transformed from a long-term carbon locker to a short-term carbon un-locker .\n\n“ This is ancient carbon , ” Dr. Commane told Alaska public radio . “ The carbon that ’ s locked in the permafrost in the Arctic is thousands and millions of years old . ”\n\nThawing permafrost can release not just CO2 , but also methane , a much stronger heat-trapping gas .\n\nWhile most models that include thawing permafrost look at CO2 , Russian scientists have recently discovered some 7,000 underground bubbles of permafrost-related methane in Siberia . Since methane traps heat 86 times more effectively than CO2 over a 20-year span , these findings suggest that the effect of the thawing permafrost is even greater than first thought .\n\nAlso , a 2008 study , “ Accelerated Arctic land warming and permafrost degradation during rapid sea ice loss , ” found that rapid sea ice loss — as has been experienced since the study was published — could triple the rate of Arctic warming .\n\nMeanwhile , the rapid Arctic warming that is fueling these emissions continues . On Monday , NASA reported that April 2017 was the second-hottest April on record — only April 2016 was hotter . As the map above shows , Arctic temperatures were blistering , up to 13.5°F ( 7.5°C ) above the 1951–1980 average .\n\nThe longer we delay aggressive climate action , the harder it will be to stuff all the toothpaste back into the tube , and the more catastrophic climate impacts we will face .\n\nThis post has been updated for clarity . Dr. Commane reached out to ThinkProgress to make clear that this process would not lead to a runaway greenhouse effect , but would exceed any increase in CO2 uptake from the increase in plant matter expected in the region due to climate change .", "label": [[1809, 1909, "Intentional"], [283, 290, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://thinkprogress.org/alaskas-vicious-cycle-warming-tundra-spews-co2-speeding-up-warming-8cf7aec95fc7", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/alaskas-vicious-cycle-warming-tundra-spews-co2-speeding-up-warming-joe-romm-think-progress/"}

{"id": 815, "data": "Inevitably , when even satellite temperatures were showing 2016 as “ the hottest year on record ” , we were going to be told last winter that the Arctic ice was at its lowest extent ever . Sure enough , before Christmas , a report from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was greeted with such headlines as “ Hottest Arctic on record triggers massive ice melt ” . In March we had the BBC trumpeting another study that blamed vanishing Arctic ice as the cause of weather which led to the worst-ever smog in Beijing , warning that it “ could even threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 ” .\n\nBut last week we were brought back to earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute ( DMI ) , as charted by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Notalotofpeopleknowthat , with the news that ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago . Furthermore , whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin , this year most has been at least two metres thick .

But one leaked detail of her dinner the previous week with Jean‑Claude Juncker and the EU ’ s chief negotiator , Michel Barnier , is worth dwelling on .\n\nTo remind Mrs May of just what she and the EU are up against in the next 18 months , Juncker was said to have plonked on the table two documents , the EU ’ s trade deal with Canada and the EU ’ s accession treaty with Croatia in 2011 .\n\nBoth are very relevant to our concerns , because Mrs May not only hopes to negotiate an unprecedented trade deal : at the end of the negotiations , there will also have to be a secession treaty , covering much of the same ground as an accession treaty , but in reverse .\n\nThe Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement ( CETA ) , which gave Canada much less access to the European market than we enjoy now , is incredibly complex , covered 1,598 pages and took seven years to negotiate . The Croatia treaty , like any accession treaty , had to cover 35 “ chapters ” or policy areas , only six of which refer to trade ; and was again extremely complex , filling 124 pages , which took six years to agree .\n\nJuncker seemingly invited Mrs May to read these documents , because they each conveyed the awesome scale of the ground her negotiations will have to cover in just 18 months . At every stage , Mr Barnier ’ s team will have to refer back to each of the 27 countries he is representing , each of which will then have to ratify what is agreed , with the power of veto if they don ’ t like it .\n\nJust leafing through those documents is a sobering corrective to any hubristic optimism about what we are taking on .", "label": [[823, 894, "Intentional"], [1206, 1277, "False Causality"], [1518, 1588, "Intentional"], [823, 894, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1102, 1191, "Intentional"], [1503, 1590, "Logical Fallacy"]], "source_url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/06/another-arctic-ice-panic-world-temperatures-plummet/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/another-arctic-ice-panic-world-temperatures-plummet-the-telegraph-christopher-booker/"}
{"id": 819, "data": "Ever since 2012 , scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that , if it ’ s correct , would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes , where hundreds of millions of people live .\n\nThe idea is that climate change doesn ’ t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves , say , or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself . By altering massive planet-scale air patterns like the jet stream ( pictured above ) , which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere , a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place . This means that a given weather pattern , whatever it may be , may persist for longer , thus driving extreme droughts , heat waves , downpours and more .\n\nThis basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate , and at the cutting edge of research , scientists continue to grapple with it . And now , a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects .\n\nPublishing in Nature Scientific Reports , Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the United States , Germany and the Netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer , the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often .\n\nThe study , its authors write , “ adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 European heat wave , the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave , the 2011 Texas heat wave and recent floods in Europe . ”\n\nBut what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream ? The basic ideas at play here get complicated fast . The study itself , for instance , refers to “ quasi-resonant amplification ( QRA ) of synoptic-scale waves ” as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening — terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide .\n\nOn the other hand , some of this isn ’ t all that complicated . The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east , driven by the rotation of the Earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the North Pole . The flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large .\n\nBut when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does — which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming , and which is already happening — the jet stream ’ s flow can become weakened and elongated . That ’ s when you can get the resultant weather extremes .\n\n“ It ’ s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable , then you ’ re not losing energy , it ’ s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television , ” said Mann . “ These waves aren ’ t losing energy , so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well . ”\n\nWhat the new study is saying is that in summer , in particular , this can occur . Moreover , it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior — and this temperature pattern , featuring an extra warm Arctic , is becoming more frequent over time , based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted .\n\n“ We think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade , ” said Mann .\n\nOne researcher who co-wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the Arctic could be driving mid-latitude weather extremes , Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin , praised the new research in an emailed comment Monday . “ This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts , ” he said .\n\nBut other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past . A recent study in Nature Geoscience , for instance , called into question whether the Arctic ’ s melting , and in particular its sea ice loss , has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia , another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes .\n\nOne author of that study , John Fyfe of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada , remarked of the Mann paper by email : “ It is well established that there has been a human influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the Northern Hemisphere . Mann et al . advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter-scale waves in the atmosphere , which are our weathermakers . I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored , but I do think that Mann et al . study is a very good start . ”\n\nThe current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer . For extremes occurring in winter , Mann said , we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior . Nonetheless , the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow , with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population .\n\nMann , who testifies before Congress this week in a session that is expected to feature a rip-roaring debate about the severity of climate change , commented , “ That ’ s going to be a fake debate . But this stuff is where the real debate is now . ”", "label": [[273, 314, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2011, 2071, "Intentional"], [5559, 5644, "False Dilemma"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/27/one-of-the-most-troubling-ideas-about-climate-change-just-found-new-evidence-in-its-favor/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/one-of-the-most-troubling-ideas-about-climate-change-just-found-new-evidence-in-its-favor-chris-mooney-washington-post/"}
{"id": 820, "data": "The record-breaking heat that made 2016 the hottest year ever recorded has continued into 2017 , pushing the world into “ truly uncharted territory ” , according to the World Meteorological Organisation .\n\nThe WMO ’ s assessment of the climate in 2016 , published on Tuesday , reports unprecedented heat across the globe , exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise .\n\nGlobal warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities , but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016 . The El Niño is now waning , but the extremes continue to be seen , with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows .\n\n“ Even without a strong El Niño in 2017 , we are seeing other remarkable changes across the planet that are challenging the limits of our understanding of the climate system . We are now in truly uncharted territory , ” said David Carlson , director of the WMO ’ s world climate research programme .\n\n“ Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere , ” said Jeffrey Kargel , a glaciologist at the University of Arizona in the US . “ In general , drastically changing conditions do not help civilisation , which thrives on stability . ”\n\nThe WMO report was “ startling ” , said Prof David Reay , an emissions expert at the University of Edinburgh : “ The need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high . ”\n\nThe new WMO assessment also prompted some scientists to criticise Donald Trump . “ While the data show an ever increasing impact of human activities on the climate system , the Trump administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand , ” said Prof Sir Robert Watson , a distinguished climate scientist at the UK ’ s University of East Anglia and a former head of the UN ’ s climate science panel .\n\n“ Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy , when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy , ” Watson said .\n\nTrump is aiming to cut climate change research . But the WMO ’ s secretary-general Petteri Taalas said : “ Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change . ”\n\n2016 saw the hottest global average among thermometer measurements stretching back to 1880 . But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years .\n\n2017 has seen temperature records continue to tumble , in the US where February was exceptionally warm , and in Australia , where prolonged and extreme heat struck many states . The consequences have been particularly stark at the poles .\n\n“ Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October , persisting for six consecutive months , something not seen before in the [ four-decade ] satellite data record , ” said Prof Julienne Stroeve , at University College London in the UK . “ Over in the southern hemisphere , the sea ice also broke new record lows in the seasonal maximum and minimum extents , leading to the least amount of global sea ice ever recorded . ”\n\nEmily Shuckburgh , at the British Antarctic Survey , said : “ The Arctic may be remote , but changes that occur there directly affect us . The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise , and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe , Asia and North America . ”\n\nGlobal sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016 , with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm . That jump would have take five years under the steady rise seen in recent decades , as ice caps melt and oceans get warmer and expand in volume . Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published .\n\nClimate change harms people most directly by increasing the risk of extreme weather events and the WMO report states that these raised risks can increasingly be calculated . For example , the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely .\n\n“ With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records , the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident , ” said Taalas .", "label": [[2626, 2643, "Faulty Generalization"], [2653, 2749, "Faulty Generalization"], [1939, 2099, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1939, 2099, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1671, 1771, "Ad Hominem"], [4336, 4492, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/21/record-breaking-climate-change-world-uncharted-territory", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-record-breaking-climate-change-pushes-world-uncharted-territory-damian-carrington-guardian/"}
{"id": 821, "data": "SYDNEY , Australia — The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has long been one of the world ’ s most magnificent natural wonders , so enormous it can be seen from space , so beautiful it can move visitors to tears .\n\nBut the reef , and the profusion of sea creatures living near it , are in profound trouble .\n\nHuge sections of the Great Barrier Reef , stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector , were recently found to be dead , killed last year by overheated seawater . More southerly sections around the middle of the reef that barely escaped then are bleaching now , a potential precursor to another die-off that could rob some of the reef ’ s most visited areas of color and life .\n\n“ We didn ’ t expect to see this level of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef for another 30 years , ” said Terry P. Hughes , director of a government-funded center for coral reef studies at James Cook University in Australia and the lead author of a paper on the reef that is being published Thursday as the cover article of the journal Nature . “ In the north , I saw hundreds of reefs — literally two-thirds of the reefs were dying and are now dead . ”\n\nThe damage to the Great Barrier Reef , one of the world ’ s largest living structures , is part of a global calamity that has been unfolding intermittently for nearly two decades and seems to be intensifying . In the paper , dozens of scientists described the recent disaster as the third worldwide mass bleaching of coral reefs since 1998 , but by far the most widespread and damaging .\n\nThe state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas . Their distress and death are yet another marker of the ravages of global climate change .\n\nIf most of the world ’ s coral reefs die , as scientists fear is increasingly likely , some of the richest and most colorful life in the ocean could be lost , along with huge sums from reef tourism . In poorer countries , lives are at stake : Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish , and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis .\n\nWith this latest global bleaching in its third year , reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party .\n\nThey warned decades ago that the coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace , releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean . Emissions continued to rise , and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs .\n\n“ Climate change is not a future threat , ” Professor Hughes said . “ On the Great Barrier Reef , it ’ s been happening for 18 years . ”\n\nCorals require warm water to thrive , but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat . Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can sometimes kill the tiny creatures .\n\nGlobally , the ocean has warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century , by a conservative calculation , and a bit more in the tropics , home to many reefs . An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet , causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880 .\n\nIt was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die , but now formal scientific assessments are coming in . The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500-mile section of the reef north of Cairns , a city on Australia ’ s eastern coast .\n\nBleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress , but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover . Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef , conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper , documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died , and would not be likely to recover soon , if at all .\n\nProfessor Hughes led those surveys . He said that he and his students cried when he showed them maps of the damage , which he had calculated in part by flying low in small planes and helicopters .\n\nHis aerial surveys , combined with underwater measurements , found that 67 percent of the corals had died in a long stretch north of Port Douglas , and in patches , the mortality reached 83 percent .\n\nBy luck , a storm stirred the waters in the central and southern parts of the reef at a critical moment , cooling them , and mortality there was much lower — about 6 percent in a stretch off Townsville , and even lower in the southernmost part of the reef .\n\nBut an Australian government study released last week found that over all , last year brought “ the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record . ”\n\nOnly 9 percent of the reef has avoided bleaching since 1998 , Professor Hughes said , and now , the less remote , more heavily visited stretch from Cairns south is in trouble again . Water temperatures there remain so high that another round of mass bleaching is underway , the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority confirmed last week .\n\nProfessor Hughes said he hoped the die-off this time would not be as serious as last year ’ s , but “ back-to-back bleaching is unheard-of in Australia. ” The central and southern part of the reef had already been badly damaged by human activities like dredging and pollution .\n\nThe Australian government has tried to combat these local threats with its Reef 2050 plan , restricting port development , dredging and agricultural runoff , among other risks . But Professor Hughes ’ s research found that , given the high temperatures , these national efforts to improve water quality were not enough .\n\n“ The reefs in muddy water were just as fried as those in pristine water , ” Professor Hughes said . “ That ’ s not good news in terms of what you can do locally to prevent bleaching — the answer to that is not very much at all . You have to address climate change directly . ”\n\nWith the election of Donald J. Trump as the American president , a recent global deal to tackle the problem , known as the Paris Agreement , seems to be in peril . Australia ’ s conservative government also continues to support fossil fuel development , including what many scientists and conservationists see as the reef ’ s most immediate threat — a proposed coal mine , expected to be among the world ’ s largest , to be built inland from the reef by the Adani Group , a conglomerate based in India .\n\n“ The fact is , Australia is the largest coal exporter in the world , and the last thing we should be doing to our greatest national asset is making the situation worse , ” said Imogen Zethoven , campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society .\n\nAustralia relies on the Great Barrier Reef for about 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue , and it is not yet clear how that economy will be affected by the reef ’ s deterioration . Even in hard-hit areas , large patches of the Great Barrier Reef survived , and guides will most likely take tourists there , avoiding the dead zones .\n\nThe global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species . The corals may save themselves , as many other creatures are attempting to do , by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms , establishing new reefs in cooler water .\n\nBut the changes humans are causing are so rapid , by geological standards , that it is not entirely clear that coral species will be able to keep up . And even if the corals do survive , that does not mean individual reefs will continue to thrive where they do now .\n\nCoral reefs are sensitive systems , built by unusual animals . The corals themselves are tiny polyps that act like farmers , capturing colorful single-celled plants called algae that convert sunlight into food . The coral polyps form colonies and build a limestone scaffolding on which to live — a reef .\n\nBut when the water near a reef gets too hot , the algae begin producing toxins , and the corals expel them in self-defense , turning ghostly white . If water temperatures drop soon enough , the corals can grow new algae and survive , but if not , they may succumb to starvation or disease .\n\nEven when the corals die , some reefs eventually recover . If water temperatures stay moderate , the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years .\n\nBut the temperature of the ocean is now high enough that global mass bleaching events seem to be growing more frequent . If they become routine , many of the world ’ s hard-hit coral reefs may never be able to re-establish themselves .\n\nWithin a decade , certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct , reef scientists say , along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators .\n\n“ I don ’ t think the Great Barrier Reef will ever again be as great as it used to be — at least not in our lifetimes , ” said C. Mark Eakin , a reef expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , in Silver Spring , Md .\n\nDr. Eakin was an author of the new paper and heads a program called Coral Reef Watch , producing predictive maps to warn when coral bleaching is imminent . Even though last year ’ s El Niño has ended , water temperatures are high enough that his maps are showing continued hot water across millions of square miles of the ocean .\n\nKim M. Cobb , a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the writing of the new paper , described it and the more recent findings as accurate , and depressing . She said she saw extensive coral devastation last year off Kiritimati Island , part of the Republic of Kiribati several thousand miles from Australia and a place she visits regularly in her research .\n\nWith the international effort to fight climate change at risk of losing momentum , “ ocean temperatures continue to march upward , ” Dr. Cobb said . “ The idea that we ’ re going to have 20 or 30 years before we reach the next bleaching and mortality event for the corals is basically a fantasy . ”", "label": [[6556, 6650, "Intentional"], [3969, 3994, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [6556, 6650, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [8669, 8746, "Faulty Generalization"], [21, 211, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/science/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff-the-new-york-times-damien-cave-justin-gillis/"}
{"id": 825, "data": "A large research synthesis , published in one of the world ’ s most influential scientific journals , has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world — a long-predicted result of climate change that could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues .\n\nThe paper , published Wednesday in the journal Nature by oceanographer Sunke Schmidtko and two colleagues from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel , Germany , found a decline of more than 2 percent in ocean oxygen content worldwide between 1960 and 2010 . The loss , however , showed up in some ocean basins more than others . The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean — the Pacific — but as a percentage , the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean , a region facing Earth ’ s most stark climate change .\n\nThe loss of ocean oxygen “ has been assumed from models , and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline , but it has never been shown on the global scale , and never for the deep ocean , ” said Schmidtko , who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck , also of GEOMAR .\n\nAD\nOcean oxygen is vital to marine organisms , but also very delicate — unlike in the atmosphere , where gases mix together thoroughly , in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish , Schmidtko explained . Moreover , he added , just 1 percent of all the Earth ’ s available oxygen mixes into the ocean ; the vast majority remains in the air .\n\nClimate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors . Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases , including oxygen . “ It ’ s the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold , ” Schmidtko said .\n\nBut another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters . Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface , from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms . But as that upper layer warms up , the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily .\n\nAD\n“ When the upper ocean warms , less water gets down deep , and so therefore , the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced , ” Schmidtko said .\n\nThe new study represents a synthesis of literally “ millions ” of separate ocean measurements over time , according to GEOMAR . The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements .\n\nThe resulting study attributes less than 15 percent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures , which create less solubility . The rest was attributed to other factors , such as a lack of mixing .\n\nMatthew Long , an oceanographer from the National Center for Atmospheric Research who has published on ocean oxygen loss , said he considers the new results “ robust ” and a “ major advance in synthesizing observations to examine oxygen trends on a global scale . ”\n\nAD\nLong was not involved in the current work , but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements , despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it .\n\nThat ’ s just what the new study has done .\n\n“ Natural variations have obscured our ability to definitively detect this signal in observations , ” Long said in an email . “ In this study , however , Schmidtko et al . synthesize all available observations to show a global-scale decline in oxygen that conforms to the patterns we expect from human-driven climate warming . They do not make a definitive attribution statement , but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline .\n\nAD\n“ It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data , ” he added .\n\n“ Schmidtko and colleagues ’ findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming , ” added Denis Gilbert , a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec , in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature .\n\nBecause oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed , the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others .\n\nMoreover , the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones , generally found in the middle depths . The great fear is that their expansion upward , into habitats where fish and other organism thrive , will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms .\n\nAD\nIn shallower waters , meanwhile , the development of ocean “ hypoxic ” areas , or so-called “ dead zones , ” may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall .\n\nOn top of all of that , declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop . In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans , microorganisms tend to produce nitrous oxide , a greenhouse gas , Gilbert writes . Thus the new study “ implies that production rates and efflux to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide … will probably have increased . ”\n\nThe new study underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans , rather than on land . In recent years , incursions of warm ocean water have caused large die-offs of coral reefs , and in some cases , kelp forests as well . Meanwhile , warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica , and as they melt , these glaciers freshen the ocean waters and potentially change the nature of their circulation .\n\nAD\nWhen it comes to ocean deoxygenation , as climate change continues , this trend should also increase — studies suggest a loss of up to 7 percent of the ocean ’ s oxygen by 2100 . At the end of the current paper , the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen .\n\n“ Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected , ” they write .", "label": [[3058, 3099, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/15/its-official-the-oceans-are-losing-oxygen-posing-growing-threats-to-marine-life/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-just-detected-major-change-earths-oceans-linked-warming-climate-chris-mooney-the-washington-post/"}
{"id": 826, "data": "STANFORD , Calif. — After five years of record-setting drought , much of California is being pummeled by an extremely wet winter . The disaster unfolding at Oroville , where precipitation is more than double the average , is the latest reminder that the United States needs a climate-smart upgrade of our water management systems .\n\nIn the West , much of our water infrastructure is old . Oroville Dam , north of Sacramento , was completed in 1968 , nearly a half a century ago . Other major components of our water system are generations older , and maintenance has not been a priority . The damage to Oroville Dam , where the primary spillway developed a giant gash and the emergency spillway threatened to erode , illustrates the hazard of relying on aging infrastructure to protect us from extreme weather .\n\nBut age and upkeep are not the only problems . Our water system was designed and built in an old climate , one in which extremely warm years were less common and snowpack was more reliable . Here in the West , we use the same dams and reservoirs for both water storage and flood control , so during the wet season , reservoir managers continuously balance the dual pressures of storing as much water as possible for the dry summer and releasing sufficient water to create room for the next storm .\n\nThis system relies on the natural reservoir of mountain snowpack , which melts gradually over the spring and summer . While it is well known that much of the West relies on snowpack for water storage , the vital role of snowpack in flood control is considerably less appreciated . When precipitation falls as snow , it stays in the mountains rather than flowing into reservoirs . This leaves more room in reservoirs to prevent flooding downstream during heavy rainfall .\n\nThe recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack-dependent water system . With the shift toward more rain rather than snow , and the earlier melting of the snowpack , water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control . This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now , with the state ’ s water managers racing to empty water from the dam ’ s reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday . Because these storms are relatively warm , they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains , speeding the flow of water behind the dam .\n\nThe juxtaposition of five years of hot , dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous . However , this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s : protracted periods of warm , dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells , with more rain and less snow , causing both drought and floods . Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging , with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent .\n\nThe other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought . Depending where one looks , California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016 . That is a lot of water to make up in one year , and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought . The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes . They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water , resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity , and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees . As a result , even after this wet year , rural communities , groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought .\n\nAs the last five years illustrate , California ’ s water system is not equipped for climate change ’ s “ new normal. ” That water system must simultaneously provide for the country ’ s largest population and agricultural sector , and one of its most diverse natural environments . Although California has greatly improved water-use efficiency in the last half-century , climate change is pushing our water system to the limit . Investments in “ climate smart ” infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future . These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs , protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate . This effort would have several key elements :\n\nFirst , given the new climate normal in which protracted hot , dry periods are far more common , we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply . While expensive , energy-intensive desalination options have received considerable attention , wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean , safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy . Investments in infrastructure to capture , store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply .\n\nSecond , we need to acknowledge that a water system that relies on snowpack for both water storage and flood control is increasingly risky . To make up for loss of snowpack , we need to build infrastructure that enables us to use excess runoff to recharge groundwater aquifers . This will have the dual benefit of replenishing groundwater that is drawn down during hot dry spells and capturing storm water that is lost when water is released for flood control .\n\nThird , we need to prioritize infrastructure that helps us reliably supply safe water to both urban and rural communities while also ensuring that our vibrant agricultural sector and treasured ecosystems have the water that they need . Creating new supply and storage will help , but ensuring equity will require that infrastructure investments simultaneously provide for all of these constituencies .\n\nFourth , although California has made tremendous progress in improving efficiency , this drought shows that there is still more room to improve . New technologies such as “ smart ” sensors , coupled with expanded water markets , offer opportunities to further increase water efficiency .\n\nEach of these infrastructure investments would increase the safety and security of Americans right now . That each would also help us to prepare for further climate change shouldn ’ t be a reason not to make those investments .", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/what-californias-dam-crisis-says-about-the-changing-climate.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/california-dam-crisis-says-changing-climate-noah-diffenbaugh-new-york-times/"}

The 2015-16 El Nino was probably the strongest since accurate measurements began , with the water up to 3C warmer than usual .\n\nIt has now been replaced by a La Nina event – when the water in the same Pacific region turns colder than normal .\n\nThis also has worldwide impacts , driving temperatures down rather than up .\n\nThe satellite measurements over land respond quickly to El Nino and La Nina . Temperatures over the sea are also falling , but not as fast , because the sea retains heat for longer .\n\nThis means it is possible that by some yardsticks , 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year .\n\nBut it is almost certain that next year , large falls will also be measured over the oceans , and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998 . If so , some experts will be forced to eat their words .\n\nLast year , Dr Schmidt said 2015 would have been a record hot year even without El Nino .\n\n‘ The reason why this is such a warm record year is because of the long-term underlying trend , the cumulative effect of the long-term warming trend of our Earth , ’ he said . This was ‘ mainly caused ’ by the emission of greenhouse gases by humans .\n\nDr Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘ pause ’ or ‘ hiatus ’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos .\n\nBut on its website home page yesterday , Nasa featured a new study which said there was a hiatus in global warming before the recent El Nino , and discussed why this was so . Last night Dr Schmidt had not returned a request for comment .\n\nHowever , both his own position , and his Nasa division , may be in jeopardy . US President-elect Donald Trump is an avowed climate change sceptic , who once claimed it was a hoax invented by China .\n\nLast week , Mr Trump ’ s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa ’ s $ 1.9 billion ( about £1.4 billion ) climate research budget .\n\nOther experts have also disputed Dr Schmidt ’ s claims . Professor Judith Curry , of the Georgia Institute of Technology , and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network , said yesterday : ‘ I disagree with Gavin . The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino . ’\n\nThe slowdown in warming was , she added , real , and all the evidence suggested that since 1998 , the rate of global warming has been much slower than predicted by computer models – about 1C per century .\n\nDavid Whitehouse , a scientist who works with Lord Lawson ’ s sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation , said the massive fall in temperatures following the end of El Nino meant the warming hiatus or slowdown may be coming back .\n\n‘ According to the satellites , the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino .\n\nThe data clearly shows El Nino for what it was – a short-term weather event , ’ he said .", "label": [[3569, 3652, "Logical Fallacy"], [0, 98, "Intentional"], [1991, 2227, "Faulty Generalization"], [461, 559, "Intentional"], [166, 253, "Intentional"], [627, 714, "Intentional"], [1051, 1108, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2713, 2747, "Intentional"], [3972, 4089, "Faulty Generalization"], [945, 1110, "Intentional"], [946, 1112, "Faulty Generalization"], [1551, 1627, "Intentional"], [4095, 4217, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3974846/Stunning-new-data-indicates-El-Nino-drove-record-highs-global-temperatures-suggesting-rise-not-man-emissions.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/stunning-new-data-indicates-el-nino-drove-record-highs-global-temperatures-david-rose-daily-mail/"}
{"id": 832, "data": "One of the world ’ s treasures , the Great Barrier Reef , just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded , Australian scientists announced Monday .\n\nStress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off . `` The coral was cooked , ” Terry Hughes , director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies , told the BBC .\n\nAt more than 1,400 miles long , Australia 's Great Barrier Reef is the world 's largest coral reef and the planet 's biggest structure made by living organisms . In the northernmost section of the reef , which had been considered the most `` pristine , '' some 67 % of the coral died .\n\nThe good news , scientists said , was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better , with `` only '' 6 % and 1 % of the coral dead , respectively .\n\nCoral reefs result from the work of little polyps , creatures only a few millimeters long , budded on top of one another . Over centuries , the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs . Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef .\n\nThe vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue . When water temperatures become too high , coral becomes stressed and expels the algae , which leave the coral a bleached white color .\n\nMass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up .\n\nBesides their beauty , reefs shelter land from storms , and are also a habitat for myriads of species .\n\n`` Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet , and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on , '' said Greg Torda , also of the Centre , in an e-mail to USA TODAY .\n\n`` These include provisioning ( fishing , other types of harvesting , for pharmaceuticals , for example ) , coastal protection , aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few . If corals are lost , so are all the services they provide to humans ; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them . ''\n\nTourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people , and generates $ 5 billion ( Australian ) in income each year , the Centre said in a statement .\n\nThe good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event . But looking to the future , mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade , Torda said .\n\nIf all the coral died on the reef , “ it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history , ” said Torda .", "label": [[2534, 2661, "Faulty Generalization"], [2733, 2778, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2016/11/28/great-barrier-reef-australia-coral-die-off/94554934/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-australia-coral-die-off-doyle-rice-usa-today/"}
{"id": 833, "data": "CNN —\nFor what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track , sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year .\n\n“ It looks like , since the beginning of October , that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels , ” said Walt Meier , a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA ’ s Goddard Space Flight Center , who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979 .\n\nWhile record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic , this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic . Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade , its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing .\n\nIn fact , each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent . Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn ’ t occurring , but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere .\n\nWhile it is too early to know if the recent , rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic , it “ certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica ’ s ice is just going up and up , ” Meier said .\n\nThe decline of sea ice has been a key indicator that climate change is happening , but its loss , especially in the Arctic , can mean major changes for your weather , too .\n\nWhat ’ s going on in the Arctic ?\nTemperatures in the Arctic have soared recently , and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why , and what the consequences will be . Air temperatures have been running more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit ( 20 degrees Celsius ) above average .\n\nAt the same time , sea ice in the northern latitudes is at a lower level than ever observed for this time of the year . October and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region , as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non-existent during what ’ s referred to as the “ polar night. ” Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered . But this year , those air temperatures are staying much warmer , closer to the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit .\n\nWhen you compare 2016 Arctic sea ice to 1984 , multiyear ice ( white color ) is on the decline .\nNASA\nTo make matters worse , the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average , which is an expected result of having less sea ice . With less ice in the summer , more of the sun ’ s rays can heat the darker water , as opposed to being deflected back into space by the white ice cover . The result is a feedback loop , and one that scientists have warned about for some time .\n\n“ The interaction between Arctic ocean temperatures and the loss of ice formation leading to continuing record minimums is clearly a climate change signal , ” said Thomas Mote , a geography research professor at the University of Georgia .\n\nAs it becomes clearer that the entire climate system in the Arctic , and potentially the Antarctic , is changing rapidly , the question now is what the impacts will be .\n\nWhy does it matter to us ?\nWhen it comes to the weather in the Arctic , it ’ s the anti-Vegas , Meier said : “ What happens in the Arctic DOES NOT stay in the Arctic . ”\n\nThe Arctic region impacts the weather in the rest of the planet – in particular , North America , Europe and Asia .\n\nDuring the Northern Hemisphere ’ s winter , the arctic cold regularly “ spills out ” into the continents and can usher in major cold air outbreaks with crippling snow and ice storms , along with dangerously cold temperatures . Usually , this is regulated by the polar vortex that circles the North Pole several miles up in the stratosphere – not to be confused with the “ polar vortex ” nickname that ’ s been attached to every cold snap and snowstorm in recent years .\n\nAny change in the polar vortex would mean a change in the frequency and intensity of winter storms in the areas where most people live .\n\nResearchers are looking at one such theory , which considers a warm Arctic and cold continents – basically , a warmer Arctic featuring less sea ice that leads to more frequent spilling of cold air that ’ s normally trapped by the polar vortex . That would mean the continents are hit with more frequent shots of Arctic air . Even though that Arctic air might not be as cold as normal , it is still plenty frigid to wreak havoc on populated places , locking them into long cold spells and major snow storms .\n\nThere ’ s a classic example of it happening right now . Large swaths of Europe and Asia have seen bitter cold and record snows over the past several weeks , all while the Arctic was bathing in temperatures 30 degrees Fahrenheit above average .\n\nIt ’ s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic , and now the Antarctic , is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice . Scientists are quick to point out that weather in these regions can change quickly , but this is another expected result of climate change . And enough examples can become trends – and trends can have consequences .", "label": [[893, 985, "Faulty Generalization"], [893, 985, "Intentional"], [1282, 1324, "Faulty Generalization"], [5235, 5309, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/world/sea-ice-arctic-antarctic-lows/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/higher-global-temperatures-sea-ice-record-lows-poles-brandon-miller-cnn/"}
{"id": 837, "data": "James Lovelock ’ s parting words last time we met were : “ Enjoy life while you can . Because if you ’ re lucky , it ’ s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan. ” It was early 2008 , and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming , which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater . The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was , he assured me , a fantasy ; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us . Before the end of this century , 80 % of the world ’ s population would be wiped out .\n\nHis predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss . Sometimes described as a futurist , Lovelock has been Britain ’ s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years . His Gaia hypothesis , which contends that the earth is a single , self-regulating organism , is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science , and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer . A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study , and a mischievous provocateur , Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius .\n\nEight years after our previous encounter , he appears to have aged not one bit . At 97 , he ’ s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “ tool kit for the future ” , The Earth and I , and written the introduction and conclusion ; he goes walking every day , his hearing is perfect , his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired . “ Yes , why not ? I ’ m writing a fiction book at the moment . It ’ s tremendous fun , you know. ” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health . “ I ’ m a firm believer that if you don ’ t use it , you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking , and if you use your muscles quite a bit , your brain seems to work as well . You ’ ve got to look at the whole system , not just bits of it . ”\n\nWhat has changed dramatically , however , is his position on climate change . He now says : “ Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot , because so many things can change unexpectedly. ” But isn ’ t that exactly what he did last time we met ? “ I know , ” he grins teasingly . “ But I ’ ve grown up a bit since then . ”\n\nLovelock now believes that “ CO2 is going up , but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would . The computer models just weren ’ t reliable . In fact , ” he goes on breezily , “ I ’ m not sure the whole thing isn ’ t crazy , this climate change . You ’ ve only got to look at Singapore . It ’ s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change , and it ’ s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in . ”\n\nThere are various possible explanations for his change of heart . One is that Lovelock is right , and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed . Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible . An incorrigible subversive , Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention , and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it , he decided we were already too late . But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again , and nowadays feels “ laid back about climate change ” . All things being equal – “ and it ’ s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models , everything else , is right off the board ” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly , something else will have made our world unrecognisable , and threaten the human race .\n\nLovelock maintains that , unlike most environmentalists , he is a rigorous empiricist , but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement . “ Well , it ’ s a religion , really , you see . It ’ s totally unscientific. ” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace , where he told Princess Anne : “ Your brother nearly killed me. ” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass-burning boilers at Highgrove , Lovelock had tried one in his house . “ It ’ s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm ; but it doesn ’ t , because it goes out , and clouds and clouds of smoke come out. ” He giggles . “ Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny . ”\n\nLovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon , where he lived for more than 35 years , inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set . He and his wife recently packed up his life ’ s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset , after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £6,000 . “ I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible , that I had to be lying . But I wasn ’ t lying , I ’ ve got the figures. ” Monbiot doesn ’ t quite accuse him of lying , in fairness ; just of “ talking rubbish ” and “ making wild statements ” . In any case , he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months , in temperatures of -20C ( -4F ) , for just £60 . As a result , he has withering contempt for environmentalists ’ opposition to fracking . “ You see , gas in America is incredibly cheap , because of fracking , ” he says . But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes ? He rolls his eyes .\n\n“ Sure enough , that ’ s true , there will be an increase . But they ’ re tiny little tremors , they would be imperceptible . The only trouble is that you can detect them . The curse of my life has been that I ’ ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive . And the moment somebody can detect something , they ’ re going to attach a number to it , and then they make a fuss about it. ” He chuckles , then pauses . “ I ’ m not anti-green in the sense that I ’ m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make . I think we ’ ve got to be careful . But I ’ m afraid , human nature being what it is , the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion , and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible . ”\n\nEven more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock ’ s passionate support for nuclear power . But , like fracking , he says , it offers only “ a stopgap ” solution . “ Because in the long term , they ’ ll use up all the uranium. ” How long would that take ? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic , as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys .\n\n“ Let ’ s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years , something in that range . It might be 100 . When you ’ ve used all that up , you go to thorium , and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so , shall we say , about 200 years ? ” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels . “ It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed , ” but it won ’ t happen “ because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up ” . So for now , nuclear energy is the only viable option .\n\nBut all this , he clarifies cheerfully , is more or less academic . “ Because quite soon – before we ’ ve reached the end of this century , even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over. ” Robots will rule the world ? “ Well , yes . They ’ ll be in charge. ” In charge of us ? “ Yes , if we ’ re still here . Whether they ’ ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise , I have no idea . ”\n\nHe isn ’ t alone in this view : the influential philosopher Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity ; Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking , among others , have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks . Still , when Lovelock outlines this vision , his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he ’ s joking . He isn ’ t . “ We ’ re already happily letting computers design themselves . This has been going on for some time now , particularly with chips , and it ’ s not going to be long before that ’ s out of our hands , and we ’ ll be standing aside and saying , ‘ Oh well , it ’ s doing a good job designing itself , let ’ s encourage it. ’ ” Computers will develop independent volition and intuition ( “ To some extent , they already have ” ) and become capable of reproducing themselves , and of evolving . “ Oh yes , that ’ s crucial . We ’ ll have a world where Darwin ’ s working. ” Darwinism doesn ’ t work now ? “ Oh no , we ’ ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards . I mean , we preserve the ones that would not have survived . ”\n\nHe pauses , and adds quickly : “ Don ’ t let ’ s get dangerous on this one . I don ’ t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out . ”\n\nLovelock doesn ’ t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over , though , despite the possibility that they will destroy us . “ Once they become at all established anywhere , that ’ s the end , because to robots time happens one million times faster – that ’ s a fairly exact figure – than it does to us . That ’ s rather wonderful in a way , isn ’ t it ? ”\n\nI ask him to explain . “ Well , for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond – which is fairly fast . But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond . It ’ s a million times faster , as simple as that . So to a robot , once fully established in that new world , a second is a million seconds . Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live , to grow up , to evolve , than we do . ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is possible , he goes on , that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue ( “ That ’ s one route ” ) , but the likelier scenario will be pure robots . Why does he think we ’ ll go for all-out robots ? He shoots me an amused look . “ I don ’ t think we will . I think that they will – that ’ s the key thing here . ”\n\nThe implications for climate change are obvious . “ The world that they ’ re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in . So once they really get established , they will – with regret – start losing organic life. ” Will they care about rising temperatures ? “ They won ’ t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature , because to them the change will be slow , and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss . They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can , before things get tricky for them . It ’ s what the world can stand that is the important thing . They ’ re going to have a safe platform to live in , so they don ’ t want Gaia messed about too much . ”\n\nNotwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions , his confidence in the robotic future he describes is “ fairly high . Yes , all sorts of things can happen , but that ’ s the intuitive feeling I have ” . As for our interaction with robots : “ Well , it ’ s going to be very peculiar. ” In the classic Frankenstein tradition , will humanity not understand what it has created until it ’ s too late ? “ Well , too late is the wrong word . Let ’ s say , until it has happened. ” The phrase “ too late ” , he explains , implies regret – but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence , “ maybe we ’ ve got some special property that they will appreciate . But then , don ’ t forget , their timescale is a million times different from ours . They ’ d have a lot of trouble talking to us. ” In the same sense that we have trouble talking to ants ? “ Oh no , it ’ s much worse than that . It ’ s really more like us talking to a giant redwood tree . And you never know , they may feel about us the same way as we feel about trees. ” They might even , I suggest , want to hug us ? Lovelock ’ s face lights up in delight . “ Yes , exactly ! Exactly . That ’ s a good one . ”\n\nLovelock was no less bafflingly cheerful when he believed climate change was about to wipe out 80 % of the world ’ s population . How can he now feel just as sanguine about a global takeover by robots ? “ One may say : ‘ Well , of course , he ’ s so old he ’ s stopped having any feelings. ’ Not true , I ’ ll say ! ” He would have been , he insists , just the same 50 years ago . “ And I would hate to think it was an affectation. ” He would rather not be called a maverick , because it makes him sound like someone who “ makes gadgets in his garage ” .\n\n“ But everything in life to me is just : ‘ Oh , isn ’ t that interesting ? ’ ”", "label": [[6133, 6204, "Ad Hominem"], [7171, 7211, "Logical Fallacy"], [7375, 7419, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [8281, 8525, "Faulty Generalization"], [1165, 1216, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2300, 2338, "Intentional"], [2138, 2155, "Ad Hominem"], [1165, 1216, "Ad Populum"], [2633, 2787, "False Causality"], [2592, 2632, "Intentional"], [499, 549, "Faulty Generalization"], [552, 638, "Faulty Generalization"], [814, 972, "Intentional"], [2080, 2206, "Intentional"], [2633, 2787, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3459, 3573, "Faulty Generalization"], [3918, 3996, "Ad Hominem"], [6482, 6607, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [10146, 10195, "Faulty Generalization"], [10146, 10195, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over-decca-aitkenhead-the-guardian/"}
{"id": 838, "data": "Green activists are at war with the greatest American foe since the Axis Powers—or so they say . The latest Democratic Party platform compares the fight against global warming to World War II .\n\nUsing terms such as `` battlefield , '' `` siege , '' and `` front , '' those opposed this `` war effort '' have been labeled anything from Nazis to Holocaust deniers . ( I personally have been called a sociopath by climate activist Joe Romm of the Center for American Progress , another story . )\n\nThe upcoming election has inspired dire concern . Don ’ t “ vote for climate catastrophe ” warned a Washington Post editorialist . “ At this point , ” stated Michael Klare , Professor of Peace and World Security at Hampshire College , “ electing green-minded leaders , stopping climate deniers ( or ignorers ) from capturing high office , and opposing fossil -fueled ultranationalism is the only realistic path to a habitable planet . ”\n\nDesperation Backfire ?\n\nEquating the Third Reich with the free society ’ s fossil-fuel reliance , and charging Republicans with climate destruction , is from the theater of the absurd . Americans care greatly about the future ; to say otherwise is to deny their very humanity . It is right and fair that critics of climate catastrophism reject calls for bigger government , tax-wise and regulation-wise .\n\nAnd the great middle can be excused for realizing that obsessing about climate change is avoiding a frank discussion about the here-and-now problems of budget deficits , the federal debt , school choice , entitlement reform , and so on .\n\nPerhaps there is good news in the ugliness of desperate activists who are trying to get their issue out front . Not only do polls suggest the public is unmoved at home and in abroad , serial exaggeration at this point is arguably backfiring , confirming the perils of climate exaggeration .\n\nUntil civility returns , our side can ask whether the critics are acting like the Gestapo of global warming . Two can play a game that should not be played at all .\n\nNo Point of No Return\n\nGlobal warming activists tout their commitment to evidence and reason . Yet their dismal track record seems to lead to only more drama and hyperbole , not humility and open-mindedness .\n\nBack in 2006 , Al Gore prophesied that unless the world dramatically reduced greenhouse gasses , we would hit a `` point of no return . '' And in his book review of Gore ’ s book and movie from that year , An Inconvenient Truth , scientist James Hansen unequivocally stated : “ We have at most ten years—not ten years to decide upon action , but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions . ”\n\nTime is up on Gore ’ s “ point of no return ” and Hansen ’ s “ critical tipping point. ” But the two fathers of the global-warming movement ( Hansen and Gore got it going back in the summer of 1988 ) have nary admitted their exaggeration nor set a new timetable for effective action .\n\nMany others have followed the same scare-and-hide pattern . Rajendra Pachauri , while head of a United Nations climate panel , pleaded that without drastic action before 2012 , it would be too late to save the planet .\n\nBack in the late 1980s , the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000 , rising sea levels would wash entire counties away . Four years ago , Peter Wadhams , professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge , predicted “ global disaster ” from the demise of Arctic sea ice—in four years . He too , is eating crow .\n\nThere is some levity in all this charade . In 2009 , then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted that the world had only 50 days to save the planet from global warming . But fifty days and years later , and the earth still spins .\n\n\n\nScience Diminished\n\nFalsified and sure-to-be-falsified exaggerations from a parade of Ph.D. scientists are ruining the reputation of science itself . Physical science has turned into profit-maximizing political science . As Judith Curry explained to Congress :\n\nIn their efforts to promote their “ cause , ” the scientific establishment behind the global warming issue has been drawn into the trap of seriously understating the uncertainties associated with the climate problem . This behavior risks destroying science ’ s reputation for honesty . It is this objectivity and honesty which gives science a privileged seat at the table . Without this objectivity and honesty , scientists become regarded as another lobbyist group .\n\nCan climate research get back on track ? Can the “ uncertainty monster ” in climate research , and particularly climate modeling , be acknowledged ? Can such study overcome the Malthusian bias ( change is bad ; mankind is at fault ) to achieve impartiality ? Can the federal role in climate research be scaled back to improve incentives and quality ?\n\nOptimism , Anyone ?\n\nThere is good news as good science drives out bad . The discrepancy between model-predicted warming and ( lower ) real-world observations has inspired new respect for natural climate variability relative to greenhouse-gas forcing .\n\n“ Although some researchers doubted the existence of a global warming hiatus because of coverage bias , artificial inconsistency , and a change point analysis of instrumental Ts records , ” a just-published study at Nature.com ’ s Scientific Reports found , “ it is now accepted that a recent warming deceleration can be clearly observed . ”\n\nSensitivity estimates—defined as the temperature effect from the enhanced greenhouse effect—have been coming down in the peer-reviewed literature , even to the point when climate economists see a positive externality , not a negative one , from the human influence on climate . ( In technical lingo , the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative . )\n\nSuch new thinking , long overdue , would shift the mainstream to a new view of the beneficence of plentiful , affordable , reliable energy . Depletion , security , and pollution fears quieted , natural gas , coal , and oil can be seen in a white light .\n\n“ Fossil fuels don ’ t take a clean environment and make it dirty , ” noted Alex Epstein , `` they take a dirty environment and make it clean. ” Fossil fuels , he adds , “ don ’ t take a safe climate and make it dangerous , they take a dangerous climate and make it safe . ”\n\nThe real news is good news in contradiction to doom-and-gloom . It is time for energy and climate planners to lay down their government arms . Let consumers and taxpayers be .\n\nRobert L.

{"id": 839, "data": "The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought , according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend .\n\nThe melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely , the oceans would rise by six metres around the world , flooding many of the world ’ s largest cities .\n\nThe new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass . When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago , its great weight depressed the hot , viscous rocks in the underlying mantle . As ice has been shed since , the island has slowly rebounded upwards .\n\nPrevious satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account , but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought , up to 12mm a year . This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year , an increase of about 8 % on earlier figures .\n\nThe faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter , more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland , a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland ’ s volcanoes .\n\nThe new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today .\n\nThis means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip , but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change . Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland ’ s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea .\n\n“ The fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future , ” said Prof Jonathan Bamber , at the University of Bristol , UK , and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study , published in Science Advances .\n\nBamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor : “ One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend . ”\n\n“ The headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change , ” said Dr Christopher Harig , at the University of Arizona , who was not involved in the study . “ The new research happening now really speaks to the question : ‘ How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century ? ’ As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets , these estimates have tended to go up . In my mind , the time for urgency about climate change [ action ] really arrived years ago , and it ’ s past time our policy reflected that urgency . ”\n\nDr Pippa Whitehouse , at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research , said : “ This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss . Using such measurements , this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean , making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean . ”\n\nThe team behind the new research said better estimates of continental rebound rates could be even more significant in estimates of ice loss from the world ’ s biggest ice cap , in Antarctica , but that sparse data from the remote continent made analysis difficult .\n\nIn April , very high temperatures led to a record-breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland , while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice .", "label": [[277, 414, "Faulty Generalization"], [277, 414, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [277, 415, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/greenlands-huge-annual-ice-loss-is-even-worse-than-thought", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/greenlands-huge-annual-ice-loss-is-even-worse-than-thought-damian-carrington-the-guardian/"}
{"id": 843, "data": "The world is careening towards an environment never experienced before by humans , with the temperature of the air and oceans breaking records , sea levels reaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone , a major international report has found .\n\nThe “ state of the climate ” report , led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) with input from hundreds of scientists from 62 countries , confirmed there was a “ toppling of several symbolic mileposts ” in heat , sea level rise and extreme weather in 2015 .\n\n“ The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle , ” Michael Mann , a leading climatologist at Penn State , told the Guardian . “ They are playing out before us , in real time . The 2015 numbers drive that home . ”\n\nLast year was the warmest on record , with the annual surface temperature beating the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.1C . This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times , largely due to a huge escalation in the production of greenhouse gases . The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again , after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event , a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world .\n\nThe oceans , which absorb more than 90 % of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere , also reached a new record temperature , with sharp spikes in the El Niño-dominated eastern Pacific , which was 2C warmer than the long-term average , and the Arctic , where the temperature in August hit a dizzying 8C above average .\n\nThe thermal expansion of the oceans , compounded by melting glaciers , resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015 . The oceans are around 70mm higher than the 1993 average , which is when comprehensive satellite measurements of sea levels began . The seas are rising at an average rate of 3.3mm a year , with the western Pacific and Indian Oceans experiencing the fastest increases .\n\nThese changes are being driven by a CO2 concentration that surpassed the symbolic 400 parts per million mark at the Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii last year . The Noaa report states that the global CO2 level was a touch under this , at 399.4ppm , an increase of 2.2ppm compared to 2014 .\n\nNoaa said other “ remarkable ” changes in 2015 include the Arctic ’ s lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37-year satellite record , recorded in February 2015 . The world ’ s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet , which would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate , experienced melting over more than 50 % of its surface .\n\nThe rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species . In June last year , a severe heatwave claimed over 1,000 lives in Karachi , Pakistan . Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia , with a lack of rainfall resulting in “ intense and widespread ” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas .\n\nDiminishing sea ice is causing major walrus herds to haul themselves out on to land . Arctic marine species , such as snailfish and polar cod , are being pushed out of the region by species coming from further south , attracted to the warming waters . A huge algal bloom off the west coast of North America harmed marine life and fisheries .\n\nScientists have said there were underlying climate change trends at play but last year was also influenced by the strong El Niño event , which is when equatorial Pacific waters warm , leading to an array of weather effects around the world . El Niño has also helped spur searing heat in 2016 but has now petered out .\n\nThomas Karl , director of Noaa national centers for environmental information , said that last year ’ s climate “ was shaped both by long-term change and an El Niño event . When we think about being climate resilient , both of these time scales are important to consider .\n\n“ Last year ’ s El Niño was a clear reminder of how short-term events can amplify the relative influence and impacts stemming from longer-term warming trends . ”\n\nKate Willett , a senior scientist at Britain ’ s Met Office , said that there was a 75 % annual increase in the amount of land that experienced severe drought last year .\n\n“ Looking at a range of climate measurements , 2015 was yet another highly significant year , ” she said . “ Not only was 2015 the warmest year on record by a large margin , it was also another year when the levels of dominant greenhouse gases reached new peaks . ”\n\nThe state of the climate report is now in its 26th year .

{"id": 844, "data": "The United States is witnessing a massive , dangerous heat wave , as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country . It ’ s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it , including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday .\n\nHere in Washington , temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend .\n\nThis will , inevitably , lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days . So it ’ s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can , and can ’ t , reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that , on a global scale , has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months .\n\nAnd the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way , for instance in their intensity , frequency , or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “ caused ” by climate change , they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection .\n\n“ As predictable as the sunrise , some will say heat waves always happened , ” said Marshall Shepherd , director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society . “ Yep , so did home runs in baseball , but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs . A new National Academies study suggests that ‘ heat waves ’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball . ”\n\nIn other words , when a planet warms , the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves . That ’ s just plain logic .\n\nIndeed , the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that , “ Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature , such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate , where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change . ”\n\n“ In particular , for extreme heat and cold events , changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions . ”\n\nAnd we ’ ve definitely already had changes in not only “ long-term mean conditions , ” but in heat waves themselves . The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “ become more frequent and intense , ” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records ( just as you ’ d expect ) , and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells .\n\nAs for future projections , meanwhile , the assessment added that “ Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5 % in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70 % of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow . ”\n\nHowever , pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather , it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event . Beyond that , specific attribution requires active research , and an attention to the actual temperatures , duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon . That ’ s because , as Shepherd notes , there are always heat waves , even in a stable climate .\n\nTypically , in such an attribution study , scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “ natural ” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models . Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast , in near real time . So don ’ t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for , most recently , the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef , which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia ’ s northeastern coast .\n\nBut in the meantime , some scientists and experts aren ’ t holding back .\n\n“ With every heat wave , probably the number one question is , is it climate change , or is it not ? Well the answer is , it ’ s both , ” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday . “ We get heat waves naturally , but climate change is amping them up , it ’ s giving them that extra energy , to make them even more serious , and have even greater impacts . ”\n\nHayhoe didn ’ t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave , any more than Shepherd did . Rather , she ’ s once again articulating the general connection .\n\n“ We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today , ” she said .\n\nIt ’ s important to underscore , as Hayhoe did , that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland . She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe , and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis . That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London , and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths , themselves , to climate change .\n\nSo these links are real , if not always simple to characterize . Now , it ’ s all about watching this current event carefully , taking preparations , and seeing what scientists have to say once they run their analyses .", "label": [[181, 196, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4374, 4409, "False Dilemma"], [1229, 1255, "Faulty Generalization"], [1770, 1797, "Miscellaneous"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/21/what-science-can-tell-us-about-the-links-between-global-warming-and-massive-heat-waves/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/science-about-links-between-global-warming-and-massive-heat-waves-chris-mooney-washington-post/"}

{"id": 850, "data": "If you dig deep enough into the Earth ’ s climate change archives , you hear about the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum , or PETM . And then you get scared .\n\nThis is a time period , about 56 million years ago , when something mysterious happened — there are many ideas as to what — that suddenly caused concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to spike , far higher than they are right now . The planet proceeded to warm rapidly , at least in geologic terms , and major die-offs of some marine organisms followed due to strong acidification of the oceans .\n\nThe cause of the PETM has been widely debated . Some think it was an explosion of carbon from thawing Arctic permafrost . Some think there was a huge release of subsea methane that somehow made its way to the atmosphere — and that the series of events might have been kickstarted by major volcanic eruptions .\n\nIn any case , the result was a hothouse world from pole to pole , some 5 degrees Celsius warmer overall . But now , new research suggests , even the drama of the PETM falls short of our current period , in at least one key respect : We ’ re putting carbon into the atmosphere at an even faster rate than happened back then .\n\nSuch is the result of a new study in Nature Geoscience , led by Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii at Manoa , and colleagues from the University of Bristol in the UK and the University of California-Riverside .\n\n“ If you look over the entire Cenozoic , the last 66 million years , the only event that we know of at the moment , that has a massive carbon release , and happens over a relatively short period of time , is the PETM , ” says Zeebe . “ We actually have to go back to relatively old periods , because in the more recent past , we don ’ t see anything comparable to what humans are currently doing . ”\n\nThat ’ s why this time period is so crucial to study — as a possible window on our own .\n\nThere ’ s no doubt that a lot of carbon — about as much as contained the fossil fuel reserves that humans have either already burned , or could still burn , combined — made its way into the atmosphere during the PETM . The result was a major warming event that lasted over 100,000 years . But precisely how rapidly the emissions occurred is another matter .\n\n“ If anthropogenic emissions rates have no analogue in Earth ’ s recent history , then unforeseeable future responses of the climate system are possible , ” the authors write .\n\nTo examine what happened in the PETM , the researchers used a deep ocean core of sediment from off the coast of New Jersey . The goal was to determine the ratios between different isotopes , or slightly different elemental forms , of carbon and oxygen , in the sediments during the PETM .\n\nThe relationship between the two lets researchers determine how atmospheric carbon dioxide levels , as reflected in the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 , in turn influenced temperatures ( which can be inferred based on oxygen isotopes in the ocean ) .\n\n“ In terms of these two systems , the first shows us when the carbon went into the system , and the second tells us when the climate responded , ” says Zeebe .\n\nIt turns out that there is a lag time between massive pulses of carbon in the atmosphere and subsequent warming , because the oceans have a large thermal inertia . Therefore , a large lag would indicate a greater carbon release , whereas the lack of one actually means that carbon dioxide came out more slowly .\n\nThe geologic evidence from the new core did not show a lag , the new study reports . That means , the authors estimate , that while a gigantic volume of carbon entered the atmosphere during the PETM — between 2,000 and 4,500 billion tons — it played out over some 4,000 years . So only about 1 billion tons of carbon were emitted per year . In contrast , humans are now emitting about 10 billion tons annually — changing the planet much more rapidly .\n\n“ The anthropogenic release outpaces carbon release during the most extreme global warming event of the past 66 million years , by at least an order of magnitude , ” writes Peter Stassen , an Earth and environmental scientist at KU Leuven , in Belgium , in an accompanying commentary on the new study .\n\nThe analogy between the PETM and the present , then , is less than perfect — and our own era may be worse in key ways . “ The two main conclusions is that ocean acidification will be more severe , ecosystems may be hit harder because of the rate ” of carbon release , says Zeebe .\n\nAnd not only have we only begun to see the changes that will result from current warming , but there may be other changes that lack any ancient parallel , because of the current rate of change .\n\n“ Given that the current rate of carbon release is unprecedented throughout the Cenozoic , we have effectively entered an era of a no-analogue state , which represents a fundamental challenge to constraining future climate projections , ” the study concludes .", "label": [[142, 156, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/03/21/what-were-doing-to-the-earth-has-no-parallel-in-66-million-years-scientists-say/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-chris-mooneys-earth-no-parallel-66-million-years/"}

Meehl , a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo .\n\nIt will take a few more years to know for certain , but the back-to-back records of 2014 and 2015 may have put the world back onto a trajectory of rapid global warming , after a period of relatively slow warming dating to the last powerful El Niño , in 1998 .\n\nPoliticians attempting to claim that greenhouse gases are not a problem seized on that slow period to argue that “ global warming stopped in 1998 , ” with these claims and similar statements reappearing recently on the Republican presidential campaign trail .\n\nStatistical analysis suggested all along that the claims were false , and that the slowdown was , at most , a minor blip in an inexorable trend , perhaps caused by a temporary increase in the absorption of heat by the Pacific Ocean .\n\n“ Is there any evidence for a pause in the long-term global warming rate ? ” said Gavin A. Schmidt , head of NASA ’ s climate-science unit , the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , in Manhattan . “ The answer is no . That was true before last year , but it ’ s much more obvious now . ”\n\nMichael E. Mann , a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University , calculated that if the global climate were not warming , the odds of setting two back-to-back record years would be remote , about one chance in every 1,500 pairs of years . Given the reality that the planet is warming , the odds become far higher , about one chance in 10 , according to Dr. Mann ’ s calculations .\n\nTwo American government agencies — NASA , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and NOAA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — compile separate analyses of the global temperature , based upon thousands of measurements from weather stations , ships and ocean buoys scattered around the world . Meteorological agencies in Britain and Japan do so , as well . The agencies follow slightly different methods to cope with problems in the data , but obtain similar results .\n\nThe American agencies released figures on Wednesday showing that 2015 was the warmest year in a global record that began , in their data , in 1880 . British scientists released figures showing 2015 as the warmest in a record dating to 1850 . The Japan Meteorological Agency had already released preliminary results showing 2015 as the warmest year in a record beginning in 1891 .\n\nOn Jan. 7 , NOAA reported that 2015 was the second-warmest year on record , after 2012 , for the lower 48 United States . That land mass covers less than 2 percent of the surface of the Earth , so it is not unusual to have a slight divergence between United States temperatures and those of the planet as a whole .\n\nThe end of the year was especially remarkable in the United States , with virtually every state east of the Mississippi River having a record warm December , often accompanied by heavy rains .\n\nA warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor , and an intensification of rainstorms was one of the fundamental predictions made by climate scientists decades ago as a consequence of human emissions . That prediction has come to pass , with the rains growing more intense across every region of the United States , but especially so in the East .\n\nThe term global warming is generally taken to refer to the temperature trend at the surface of the planet , and those are the figures reported by the agencies on Wednesday .\n\nSome additional measurements , of shorter duration , are available for the ocean depths and the atmosphere above the surface , both generally showing an inexorable long-term warming trend .\n\nMost satellite measurements of the lower and middle layers of the atmosphere show 2015 to have been the third- or fourth-warmest year in a 37-year record , and scientists said it was slightly surprising that the huge El Niño had not produced a greater warming there . They added that this could yet happen in 2016 .\n\nWhen temperatures are averaged at a global scale , the differences between years are usually measured in fractions of a degree . In the NOAA data set , 2015 was 0.29 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2014 , the largest jump ever over a previous record . NASA calculated a slightly smaller figure , but still described it as an unusual one-year increase .\n\nThe intense warmth of 2015 contributed to a heat wave in India last spring that turns out to have been the second-worst in that country ’ s history , killing an estimated 2,500 people . The long-term global warming trend has exacted a severe toll from extreme heat , with eight of the world ’ s 10 deadliest heat waves occurring since 1997 .\n\nOnly rough estimates of heat deaths are available , but according to figures from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters , in Brussels , the toll over the past two decades is approaching 140,000 people , with most of those deaths occurring during a European heat wave in 2003 and a Russian heat wave in 2010 .\n\nThe strong El Niño has continued into 2016 , raising the possibility that this year will , yet again , set a global temperature record . The El Niño pattern is also disturbing the circulation of the atmosphere , contributing to worldwide weather extremes that include a drought in southern Africa , threatening the food supply of millions .", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/science/earth/2015-hottest-year-global-warming.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-justin-gillis-2015-hottest-year-global-warming/"}
{"id": 856, "data": "At a time of intense planetary warming , it ’ s odd to even contemplate a counterfactual world in which we might instead be in or heading into a glacial period , sometimes more popularly called an “ ice age . ”\n\nBut new research published Wednesday in the influential journal Nature suggests that we may have had a close scrape with such a period earlier in the current geological epoch known as the Holocene — and that pre-industrial human modifications of the climate through agriculture , fires and deforestation might have just barely staved it off .\n\n“ Humanity narrowly escaped a glacial inception in the middle of the Holocene , which was almost suppressing the formation of civilization , ” says Hans Joachim Schellnhuber , one of the paper ’ s three authors and founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research ( the other authors are also affiliated with the institute ) .\n\nMoreover , the study says , massive human greenhouse gas emissions since that time have likely “ postponed ” what might otherwise be another ice age “ by at least 100,000 years . ”\n\nThe new research is based on the idea that there are two key factors that shape whether the Earth goes into an ice age ( or glacial period ) or not . There ’ s one that humans can influence , as well as one they really can ’ t .\n\nThe factor out of our control is the Earth ’ s Milankovitch cycles , which describe the erratic way in which the planet orbits the sun and spins on its axis over vast time periods . The Earth ’ s orbit grows slowly more and less elliptical , even as the angle of the planet ’ s axial tilt , and the wobble of the poles as the planet spins ( much like what you see with a spinning top ) , also change slightly over thousands of years .\n\nAll of this can affect the delivery of sunlight over different parts of the Earth and the nature of the seasons — for instance , causing summers to be colder — and thus , whether it ’ s possible to build up huge ice masses on land . Critically , how much sun the Earth ’ s northern hemisphere high latitudes receive in summer shapes whether ice can build up there over long periods , the new study says .\n\nBut there ’ s also a second factor that ’ s in our control — how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere . We are able to turn this knob by how many forests we cut down and how many fossil fuels we burn , both processes that transfer carbon from the land ( or beneath it ) into the atmosphere .\n\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide traps heat and so causes an overall warming effect , and this will happen no matter where the planet is in its various orbital cycles . And if there ’ s enough of it , it can counteract the tendency of these cycles to make and then unmake ice ages .\n\n“ We wanted to understand what is really triggering glacial inception , and what we found is an amazingly simple function , which is the ratio between insolation around 65 north latitude and the CO2 content of the atmosphere , ” Schellnhuber said . “ And this is more or less summarizing the two key factors in the development of glacial cycles over the last at least 800,000 years . ”\n\nSpecifically , using analysis of past planetary glaciations and a computer model of the Earth that is able to predict their occurrence , the researchers found that carbon dioxide concentrations were only slightly too high to push us into glaciation a few thousand years ago . Instead , we enjoyed the relatively friendly ( for humans ) interglacial climate of the Holocene .\n\n“ The Earth system would already be well on the way towards a new glacial state if the pre-industrial CO2 level had been merely 40 [ parts per million ] lower than it was during the late Holocene , ” the authors write . Indeed , they note that about 800,000 years ago , orbital alignments were similar but carbon dioxide concentrations were around 240 parts per million , and glaciation did indeed occur .\n\nIt ’ s important to note that at present , the Earth is not fully deglaciated — we still have major ice sheets atop Greenland and especially Antarctica . However , in a period of glacial maximum , ice sheets would also cover northern Europe and much of North America , placing vastly more total ice atop land and thus leading to sea levels radically lower than they are at present .\n\nA key question raised by the research then becomes why carbon dioxide concentrations were higher during the Holocene — the current geological epoch that began 11,700 years ago , unless you agree with some scientists that we ’ ve now entered the “ Anthropocene ” — and whether this is natural . Here , the authors walk up to , but do not fully embrace , the idea that humans substantially altered the climate long before the industrial revolution , and specifically , that they upped atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from around 240 parts per million to 280 parts per million through deforestation , agriculture and other means .\n\nThis idea is credited to University of Virginia climate scientist William Ruddiman , who was not involved with the current paper . Asked to comment on it , Ruddiman agreed with the work overall but questioned why the authors didn ’ t more fully embrace his thesis ( which they call “ debatable ” ) , and the idea that pre-industrial humans headed off a coming ice age through their alterations of the planet ’ s land surface , even without mass burning of fossil fuels ( yet ) .\n\n“ While there is little doubt that industrial-era anthropogenic emissions are now forestalling any possibility of a new ice age , the evidence shown here suggests that this major human intervention started millennia ago , ” Ruddiman said in a statement to The Post .\n\nIf Ruddiman ’ s hypothesis is right , then combined with the new research , it would suggest that burgeoning human civilization basically headed off an ice age before that ice age could complicate matters for human civilization , making its establishment and growth considerably more difficult , especially in some key northern hemisphere regions .\n\nAnd just as the current study ’ s analysis allows for an explanation of why we did not recently begin an ice age , so it also allows for an assessment of when another is likely to occur . After all , we ’ ve since gone far beyond any pre-industrial alterations of Earth ’ s climate and driven atmospheric carbon dioxide levels up to 400 parts per million , with peak concentrations still not yet achieved .\n\nIf we had maintained planetary carbon dioxide levels at about 280 parts per million — the pre-industrial level that apparently averted ice age onset — then the research suggests that we may then have enjoyed a relatively stable climatic optimum , conditions that were friendly for civilization for about 50,000 years , without tipping into glaciation or experiencing extreme warming .\n\nInstead , and depending on how much more carbon dioxide we emit , the research says , the planet may not see large ice sheets build for 100,000 years . ( It takes a very long time for atmospheric carbon dioxide to be naturally removed again from the atmosphere . )\n\nIndeed , with all the atmospheric CO2 , we ’ re currently headed in the opposite direction : We ’ re now seeing major changes in Greenland and Antarctica , though it ’ s not clear yet just how much of these remaining ice sheets we could lose .\n\n“ The next two glacial inceptions will be suppressed by the current cumulative emissions , plus the emissions we will unavoidably have over the next 40 to 50 years , even if we keep global warming below 1.5 to 2 degrees , ” Schellnhuber said .\n\n“ The ice ages are called off , if you like , by human interference , ” he said .", "label": [[1057, 1083, "Faulty Generalization"], [4994, 5057, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3727, 3867, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/01/13/scientists-say-humans-have-basically-canceled-the-next-ice-age/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-of-chris-mooney-scientists-say-human-greenhouse-gas-emissions-have-canceled-the-next-ice-age/"}

Next week he will be in Paris , a city terrorized yet again by mass murderers , for a summit with other world leaders on climate change , not terrorism . What precisely makes these world leaders so convinced that climate change is a more urgent and massive threat than the incessant rampages of Islamist violence ?\n\nIt can not be what is happening to world temperatures , because they have gone up only very slowly , less than half as fast as the scientific consensus predicted in 1990 when the global-warming scare began in earnest . Even with this year ’ s El Niño-boosted warmth threatening to break records , the world is barely half a degree Celsius ( 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than it was about 35 years ago . Also , it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years .\n\nNor can it be the consequences of this recent slight temperature increase that worries world leaders . On a global scale , as scientists keep confirming , there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms , floods or droughts , while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer , thanks to modern technology and infrastructure . Arctic sea ice has recently melted more in summer than it used to in the 1980s , but Antarctic sea ice has increased , and Antarctica is gaining land-based ice , according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology . Sea level continues its centuries-long slow rise—about a foot a century—with no sign of recent acceleration .\n\nPerhaps it is the predictions that worry the world leaders . Here , we are often told by journalists that the science is “ settled ” and there is no debate . But scientists disagree : They say there is great uncertainty , and they reflected this uncertainty in their fifth and latest assessment for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer by the latter part of the century—that is , anything from mildly beneficial to significantly harmful .\n\nAs for the impact of that future warming , a new study by a leading climate economist , Richard Tol of the University of Sussex , concludes that warming may well bring gains , because carbon dioxide causes crops and wild ecosystems to grow greener and more drought-resistant . In the long run , the negatives may outweigh these benefits , says Mr. Tol , but “ the impact of climate change does not significantly deviate from zero until 3.5°C warming . ”", "label": [[836, 963, "Intentional"], [836, 964, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1121, 1328, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1121, 1329, "Intentional"], [465, 600, "Intentional"], [727, 834, "Intentional"], [1577, 1686, "Intentional"], [12, 111, "Intentional"], [268, 428, "Intentional"], [114, 428, "False Dilemma"], [146, 191, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [836, 964, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1890, 1907, "Equivocation"]], "source_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-complete-guide-to-the-climate-debate-1448656890", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-of-matt-ridley-benny-peiser-your-complete-guide-to-the-climate-debate/"}
{"id": 861, "data": "As the world warms , more and more coastlines are under threat from flooding . Melting ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions , along with warming ocean waters , are already producing noticeable rises in sea levels . That much is uncontroversial among scientists , and sea-level rise is a major worry for people living in coastal cities and on islands .\n\nA new paper by prominent climate scientist James Hansen and colleagues says even a moderate increase in global temperatures could lead to much greater sea level rise than the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report predicts . Since the IPCC report ( last published in 2013 ) is based on the work of thousands of climate researchers , many people are skeptical of the new paper . Again , this is n't because they doubt climate change is real or that sea-level rise is a big problem . Instead , the critics ' concerns are about the details of the model Hansen and his coauthors use .\n\nBased on current trends , Hansen and colleagues modeled how quickly ocean levels are rising . They considered the rate of ice sheet melting in Greenland and Antarctica , along with increases in water temperature . Comparing those present data to models of climate and ocean levels in ancient times , they conclude sea levels could rise several meters in the next century . That catastrophic increase would happen even if global temperatures are held to the conservative limit of 2° Celsius increase , proposed as a reasonable goal by many agencies .\n\nThe broad outlines of the paper are within the norm for climate research , but the details are at odds with other studies . The obvious disagreement is the amount of sea level rise , which in this paper is a much higher rate of increase than other models show . Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) writes that the new paper mishandles important short-term climate fluctuations such as the El Niño phenomenon , which can make individual years much warmer than the average . In other words , record-breaking temperatures this year are specifically from El Niño , but the general increase in global temperatures is part of the trend due to climate change .\n\nJames Hansen is well known for his role in bringing scientists ' worries over climate change to a much wider audience , when he testified before Congress in 1988 . He has stated that this new paper could be his most important work , an understandable sentiment . If the results of this paper are true , then rapid sea-level rise will disrupt the lives of huge numbers of people around the world , and governments need to take action immediately .\n\nBut that of course is where things can get sticky . Historically , climate scientists have been more conservative than not in making public statements to avoid alarmism and giving fuel to powerful denialist voices . They may not have science on their side , but those who claim either that climate change is n't real or say it 's not a big problem have a lot of money and media platforms . The deniers happily pounce on any tiny misstep , real or perceived , by climate researchers and those of us who report on their findings .\n\nAnother paper , published yesterday in Nature , had less fanfare than the Hansen paper , but shows the severe danger of flooding in coastal regions , particularly in the United States . This risk is n't directly from sea-level rise , but from the intensification of storm surges and increased precipitation that are secondary effects of climate change . Flooding risk in any particular place depends on a number of factors : the flatness of land right by the water , how steep the continental shelf is off the coast , the number and severity of storms , etc . That 's why much of the state of Florida is at greater risk than coastal cities in California .\n\nAs the Nature paper shows , heavier rainfall combines with storm surges , the rush of water toward the shore during major storms , to amplify flooding . That combination is deadly : thanks to sea-level rise due to climate change , flooding is going to get much worse . To put it another way : we do n't need the ocean to rise several meters to create severe floods . The next decade of `` normal '' hurricanes and tropical storms could bring the effects of climate change right into coastal cities . Updated : I stated initially that extreme storms will increase in frequency and severity , which is not a claim made by the authors of the Nature paper . Rather , usual storms at their regular frequency are enough of a problem , especially when coupled with sea-level rise .\n\nAbout 40 percent of the population of the United States lives in coastal counties , and many of the world 's major cities are similarly close to the ocean . Even if the critics are right and the alarmist predictions from Hansen and colleagues are n't correct , we 're not out of trouble .\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

{"id": 862, "data": "The epic amount of rain that led to deadly , catastrophic flooding across large parts of South Carolina and North Carolina is an example of exactly the type of supercharged storm system climate scientists have been warning about for years as a likely consequence of global warming . This storm , like others that have come before it -- from a massive deluge that flooded Oklahoma City to a flooding event in Houston , both of which occurred earlier this year -- are examples of how the atmosphere is behaving in new ways now that there 's more water vapor and heat for weather systems to work with . [ seealso url= '' http : //mashable.com/2015/10/04/columbia-flood-instagram/ # 7rmowljW2gqC '' ] It 's not that heavy downpours and floods did n't occur before manmade global warming became evident ( for the record , they did ) . The issue now is that these events are even more severe than they otherwise would have been . And they are becoming more frequent in many areas . Though there are significant limits on what climate scientists can say at this point about an event like the South Carolina floods , it 's well-established that global warming has already led to a measurable increase in global atmospheric water vapor levels , and this moisture can be wrung out as heavier bursts of rain or snow . It is also well-established in scientific literature that precipitation is increasingly falling in short , intense bursts rather than long-lasting , generally lighter events .\n\nThe risk for extreme precipitation events is increasing in many parts of the world . One study , for example , showed that a 1-in-100 year winter-rainfall event in parts of the United Kingdom is already occurring more frequently , becoming a 1-in-80 year event . This means that an event with a 1 % chance of occurring each year now has a 1.25 % risk of occurring in any particular winter , which translates to a 25 % increase in risk , according to Oxford University scientists .\n\nWater vapor and the Carolina firehose\nWhile it 's too soon to say precisely how global warming may have affected the rare confluence of events that conspired to dump at least 26.88 inches of rain in less than four days on South Carolina , changes in extreme precipitation events are one of global warming 's most well-documented climate change impacts . First , consider how significant this rainfall event has been . Charleston and Columbia saw so much rain in four days that they both blew past their previous records for the all-time wettest October , along with setting numerous other milestones .\n\nAcross South Carolina , nearly 400 roads and 158 bridges were closed on Monday due to the flooding that killed nine . More than two dozen evacuation shelters are open , and 30,000 residents are still without power . [ video id=c1NzExeDrZh0dAia4f71ppd3qcKOtonn ] The record-shattering rains in Charleston and Columbia , as well as other parts of North and South Carolina , were rarer than a 1-in-1,000 year event , based on recurrence intervals from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . This means that they 'd have just a 0.1 % chance or less of occurring in a given year .\n\n\nAs many climate scientists will say , though , we seem to be seeing more and more 500-year to 1,000-year events lately , to the point where the definition of such events and their return intervals may need to change .\nHow did this happen ?\nThere were four main meteorological players in this extreme weather event , each of which raised the odds for a record rainfall event in the Carolinas and caused weather forecasters to sound the alarm for the Palmetto State as early as midweek last week . These atmospheric players include an upper-level low-pressure area across the Southeast ; a stationary front with an area of low pressure riding along it ; Hurricane Joaquin , which passed off the East Coast and moved close to Bermuda ; as well as a strong area of high pressure parked across southern Quebec.These weather systems led to multiple moisture feeds directed at the Carolinas in firehose-like fashion for an unusually long time . Rainfall rates of 1-to-4 inches per hour or higher were recorded in the Charleston area and other locations for multiple hours at a time .\n\nThe creeping progress of the weather pattern , with the blocking high across Quebec playing a role in this , helped keep this firehose in place for days -- from Thursday through Monday . Some studies have shown that stuck weather patterns have become more common in recent years , potentially tied to rapid Arctic warming , though this link is not accepted by all of the mainstream climate science community . Think of some of these weather systems as pipelines directly connected to major moisture sources : the unusually mild waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean ; milder-than-average waters of the western Atlantic ; and a water-laden Hurricane Joaquin .\nClimate change increases risk of extreme rainfall events\nAcross the U.S. as a whole , the frequency of 2-inch or greater rainstorms has increased in recent decades , and extreme precipitation events have been on the rise across the Northern Hemisphere as well . A Climate Central analysis released in May found that 40 of the lower 48 states have seen an overall increase in heavy downpours ( the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1 % of all rain and snow days ) since 1950 . However , South Carolina was one of the few states that did not see an increase , based on that analysis . In fact , it saw a slight decrease in the frequency of heavy precipitation events . Neighboring states , including Georgia and North Carolina , did see increases , though.Sea Surface Temperature AnomalyIn general , warm air holds more moisture and evaporates more moisture from the soils and the ocean , which is also milder than it used to be . Ocean temperatures off the Southeast are above average for this time of year , which may have added more water vapor to this event , thereby giving the storm more energy to work with . Specific so-called `` climate attribution '' studies examining the role that global warming may have played in this event may take several weeks to months for scientists to complete . Michael Mann , who directs Earth Systems Science Center at Penn State University , told Mashable in an email that this storm is `` yet another example , like Sandy , or Irene , of weather on 'steroids , ' another case where climate change worsened the effects of an already extreme meteorological event . '' `` In this case , we ’ re seeing once-in-a-thousand year flooding along the South Carolina coastline as a consequence of the extreme supply of moisture streaming in from hurricane Joaquin , '' he said.East Coast Rainstorm South CarolinaJoaquin intensified over record warm sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic , which both allowed it to intensify rapidly despite adverse wind shear , and which provided it with unusually high levels of moisture -- moisture which is now being turned into record rainfall . Kevin Trenberth , a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Colorado , is a prominent climate scientist who has been outspoken about tying global warming to the characteristics of extreme weather events . He has pointed out , in scientific papers and public appearances , that because global warming has added heat and moisture to the atmosphere , every weather event that occurs now is different than it would have been had it occurred several decades ago.APTOPIX East Coast Rainstorm South CarolinaFor example , this storm occurred during a year that has at least a 97 % chance of being Earth 's warmest on record , and at a time when the planet 's oceans are the warmest they 've been since such records began in the late 19th century . The tricky part for scientists lies in figuring out exactly how those changes manifest themselves , and how significant they are relative to other factors , such as natural climate variability . `` Global warming means more ocean heat and abundant surface water vapor waiting to be gathered by a storm , '' Trenberth wrote in an email to Mashable . A slow-moving storm such as this one , he said , `` dumps it all in one place . '' `` This is increasingly occurring in different places and times and is to be expected from climate change , '' Trenberth said . He also cited the ongoing strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific , which has helped drive global ocean temperatures to their highest temperature on record , as a possible factor behind this storm system . `` El Niño means all action is in [ the ] Pacific , '' which suppresses tropical storm and hurricane activity in the Atlantic . `` This means build up of heat that waits for an opportunity to escape in some sense . '' Myles Allen , who leads the climate dynamics group at the University of Oxford and has participated in several climate attribution studies , was more cautious about linking the South Carolina extreme rainfall and flooding to global warming . `` All other things being equal , increasing atmospheric moisture resulting from large-scale warming would allow more such events to occur , '' he wrote in an email to Mashable . `` But other impacts of climate change , such as changing circulation patterns , could work in the opposite direction : so it ’ s an interesting question whether human influence on climate made this event more or less likely to occur , but not one on which we should jump to conclusions without doing the necessary analysis , '' he said .\n\nSea level rise makes matters worse\nFor coastal residents of the Carolinas , particularly those in Charleston , there was another climate change-related factor that helped accentuate the flooding : sea level rise . Onshore winds associated with the squeeze play between a surface low-pressure area in the Southeast and the high-pressure area over the northeast helped drive high tides in Charleston to levels not seen since Hurricane Hugo made landfall there in 1989 .\n\nThis exacerbated flooding caused by heavy rain , since the tide level prevented waters and sewage from draining out of the city at times . According to Ben Strauss , a climate scientist at Climate Central who focuses on sea level rise , this flood event was a preview of what 's to come for cities like Charleston as they face the prospect of more coastal flood events . `` This provides a mostly unrelated preview of what high tide could look like in Charleston after [ the ] sea level rise we could see later this century , '' Strauss wrote in an email.Charleston TideClimate Central 's sea level rise report for South Carolina found that more than 800 square miles of land lie less than 4 feet above the high-tide line in South Carolina , including $ 24 billion in property value . `` Every coastal flood today is already wider , deeper and more damaging because of the roughly 8 inches of warming-driven global sea level rise that has taken place since 1900 , '' the report found . `` Since sea level rise multiplies extreme coastal flood risk , and global warming contributes to sea level rise , global warming multiplies flood risk .

There was a 300-year-long Medieval heat wave , followed by a Little Ice Age that began around 1300 , and then the 300-year warming period we ’ re in now .\n\nThe Anchorage Daily Times ran a front-page story in 1922 recording the “ unheard-of temperatures ” in the Arctic and glaciers disappearing . “ The Arctic Ocean is warming up and icebergs are growing scarcer . ”\n\nOblivious to the history of constant climate change , Obama pointed to Exit Glacier and said : “ We want to make sure our grandkids can see this . ”\n\nHe may get his wish , but it won ’ t be because of anything he ’ s doing . The current warming trend appears to be over , speculates Roger Cohen , a fellow of the American Physical Society . The Alaska Climate Research Center reports almost no evidence of warming trends in Alaska since 1977 .\n\nMany scientists are predicting the onset of two or three centuries of cooler weather — which would mean bigger glaciers . That ’ s despite the world ’ s growing use of fossil fuels . No matter what humans do , temperature trends go up , and then down ; glaciers expand and then recede ; sea levels rise and then fall , explains Will Happer , professor emeritus of physics at Princeton .\n\nThat doesn ’ t mean pollution controls are futile . We all want to breathe clean air . But don ’ t blame climate change on humans . There are bigger forces at work here .\n\nScientists disagree about what these forces are , and are researching better ways of accurately measuring temperature trends via satellite . Amid all this controversy and uncertainty about global climate change , Obama blindly insists that his theory of global warming “ is beyond dispute ” and attacks his critics as “ deniers . ”\n\nSounding more like an Old Testament doomsayer than a president , Obama warned in his Alaska speech that unless carbon fuels are restricted , “ we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair : Submerged countries . Abandoned cities . Fields no longer growing. ” Sounds scary , but he ’ s on thin ice backing up those predictions .\n\nDespite Obama ’ s professed concern for the people of Alaska affected by climate change , his visit was more about theatrics than helping locals . Alaska ’ s Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski lambasted Obama ’ s job-killing new restrictions on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic . Obama says the region ’ s “ very fragile , ” but Murkowski is more worried that the economy is fragile . “ It ’ s clear this administration does not care about us and sees us as nothing but a territory , ” she said .\n\nIt ’ s a demonstration of Obama ’ s appalling lack of priorities . The president told his Alaska audience that “ few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. ” Really , Mr. President ? How about the epidemic of cop shootings in the United States , or the drowned toddlers washing up on Mediterranean shores as families flee the Middle East , or ISIS beheading thousands of Christians ?\n\nObama says that with climate change , more than any other issue , “ there is such a thing as being too late. ” Tell that to a cop ’ s widow or the father who watched his family drown .", "label": [[511, 628, "Logical Fallacy"], [2615, 2677, "Ad Hominem"], [781, 1063, "Intentional"], [1661, 1720, "Intentional"], [1905, 1973, "Intentional"], [2201, 2279, "Intentional"], [3684, 3875, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3685, 3875, "Intentional"], [60, 85, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [390, 446, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [533, 542, "Equivocation"], [836, 858, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [543, 571, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [919, 1007, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1722, 1737, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1844, 1904, "Logical Fallacy"], [2110, 2196, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2495, 2613, "Ad Hominem"], [2615, 2677, "Ad Hominem"], [3494, 3532, "Ad Hominem"], [3650, 3875, "Intentional"], [3650, 3875, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3988, 4061, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "https://nypost.com/2015/09/07/wake-up-obama-climate-change-has-been-happening-forever/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/betsy-mccaughey-wake-up-obama-climate-change-has-been-happening-forever/"}
{"id": 867, "data": "Two events last week brought yet further twists to one of the longest-running farces of our modern world . One was the revelation by the European Space Agency that in 2013 and 2014 , after years when the volume of Arctic ice had been diminishing , it increased again by as much as 33 per cent . The other was that Canadian scientists studying the effect of climate change on Arctic ice from an icebreaker had to suspend their research , when their vessel was called to the aid of other ships trapped in the thickest summer ice seen in Hudson Bay for 20 years .\n\nFor more than a decade now , the belief that , thanks to global warming , Arctic ice was vanishing has been for the warmists the ultimate poster-child for their cause ( along with those “ vanishing ” polar bears ) . In 2007 , with the aid of scientists such as Wieslaw Maslowski and Peter Wadhams , the BBC and others were telling us that the Arctic would be totally “ ice free by 2013 ” ( the Independent even cleared its front page to announce that the ice could all have disappeared within weeks ) .\n\nBy 2011 , the BBC ’ s science editor Richard Black was telling us that the ice would “ probably be gone within this decade ” . In 2012 , his colleague Roger Harrabin was reporting that the sea ice was now melting so fast that more had vanished that summer than “ at any time since satellite records began ” .\n\nSo taken in had others been by all these dire predictions , that in 2008 the activist Gordon Lewis Pugh , after speaking at a conference alongside\n\nAl Gore , set out to paddle a kayak to the North Pole – only to have to abort his trip after a few days because “ the ice was too thick ” . In 2009 , the three-man Caitlin expedition , sponsored by a “ climate risk ” insurance company , and backed by the BBC and the Prince of Wales , set out to walk to the North Pole . Their intention was to measure the thickness of the vanishing ice with an electronic instrument , but it froze so hard that they had to resort to a tape measure . Again , after a few weeks , they had to be airlifted back to a rescue ship because the constantly shifting ice was “ too thick ” .\n\nIn December 2013 , the world followed agog the plight of yet another “ scientific expedition ” , when 52 climate activists , accompanied by reporters from the BBC and the Guardian , sailed into the Antarctic to measure the effects of global warming on its sea-ice . By Christmas their ship was so dangerously trapped by thick , multi-year ice that they had to be helicoptered to a Chinese ship 10 miles away , which itself then got so trapped in ice that they had to be airlifted again to two other ships even further away .\n\nWhat made all this particularly absurd was that , despite being led by an Australian scientist , they were so taken in by the make-believe that they seemed quite oblivious to the satellite records showing that Antarctic sea-ice had long been expanding to such record levels that these more than matched any decline in the Arctic ice at the other end of the world . But wasn ’ t the whole point of this warming that it was meant to be “ global ” ?\n\nOf course , the reason why they have all wanted the ice at the poles to melt , not least on the land in Antarctica and Greenland , is that this would bring about their ultimate scare scenario : those sea levels rising by as much as 20 feet , which , as Al Gore showed in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth , would flood New York , Shanghai and many of the world ’ s most populous cities .\n\nBut , alas , it just isn ’ t happening . In recent years there has been more polar ice in the world than at any time since satellite records began in 1979 . In the very year they had forecast that the Arctic would be “ ice free ” , its thickness increased by a third . Polar bear numbers are rising , not falling . Temperatures in Greenland have shown no increase for decades .\n\nThe greatest scare story of all simply isn ’ t turning out as their computer models predicted . And no one has been more dangerously taken in by this silly scare story than the warmists themselves .", "label": [[778, 1064, "Intentional"], [1524, 2138, "Intentional"], [3031, 3112, "Intentional"], [51, 104, "Ad Hominem"], [107, 560, "Intentional"], [1066, 1374, "Intentional"], [2140, 2664, "Intentional"], [2575, 2589, "Intentional"], [3527, 3552, "Intentional"], [3631, 3669, "Intentional"], [3782, 3889, "Intentional"], [3932, 3987, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11763272/How-Arctic-ice-has-made-fools-of-all-those-poor-warmists.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-christopher-booker-arctic-ice-has-made-fools-of-warmists/"}

{"id": 873, "data": "Last year was the hottest on earth since record-keeping began in 1880 , scientists reported on Friday , underscoring warnings about the risks of runaway greenhouse gas emissions and undermining claims by climate change contrarians that global warming had somehow stopped .\n\nExtreme heat blanketed Alaska and much of the western United States last year . Records were set across large areas of every inhabited continent . And the ocean surface was unusually warm virtually everywhere except near Antarctica , the scientists said , providing the energy that fueled damaging Pacific storms .\n\nIn the annals of climatology , 2014 surpassed 2010 as the warmest year . The 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1997 , a reflection of the relentless planetary warming that scientists say is a consequence of human activity and poses profound long-term risks to civilization and nature .\n\n“ Climate change is perhaps the major challenge of our generation , ” said Michael H. Freilich , director of earth sciences at NASA , one of the agencies that track global temperatures .\n\nOf the large land areas where many people live , only the eastern portion of the United States recorded below-average temperatures in 2014 , in sharp contrast to the unusual heat in the West . Some experts think the weather pattern that produced those American extremes is an indirect consequence of the release of greenhouse gases , though that is not proven .\n\nSeveral scientists said the most remarkable thing about the 2014 record was that it had occurred in a year that did not feature a strong El Niño , a large-scale weather pattern in which the Pacific Ocean pumps an enormous amount of heat into the atmosphere .\n\nSkeptics of climate change have long argued that global warming stopped around 1998 , when an unusually powerful El Niño produced the hottest year of the 20th century . Some politicians in Washington have seized on that claim to justify inaction on emissions .\n\nBut the temperature of 1998 is now being surpassed every four or five years , and 2014 was the first time that happened without a significant El Niño . Gavin A. Schmidt , head of NASA ’ s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan , said the next strong El Niño would probably rout all temperature records .\n\n“ Obviously , a single year , even if it is a record , can not tell us much about climate trends , ” said Stefan Rahmstorf , head of earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany . “ However , the fact that the warmest years on record are 2014 , 2010 and 2005 clearly indicates that global warming has not ‘ stopped in 1998 , ’ as some like to falsely claim . ”\n\nSuch claims are unlikely to go away , though . John R. Christy , an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is known for his skepticism about the seriousness of global warming , pointed out in an interview that 2014 had surpassed the other record-warm years by only a few hundredths of a degree , well within the error margin of global temperature measurements . “ Since the end of the 20th century , the temperature hasn ’ t done much , ” Dr. Christy said . “ It ’ s on this kind of warmish plateau . ”\n\nDespite such arguments from a handful of scientists , the vast majority of those who study the climate say the earth is in a long-term warming trend that is profoundly threatening and caused almost entirely by human activity .\n\nThey expect the heat to get much worse over coming decades , but already it is killing forests around the world , driving plants and animals to extinction , melting land ice and causing the seas to rise at an accelerating pace .\n\n“ It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be witnessing a record year of warmth , during a record-warm decade , during a several decades-long period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled for more than a thousand years , were it not for the rising levels of planet-warming gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels , ” Michael E. Mann , a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University , said in an email .\n\nNASA and the other American agency that maintains long-term temperature records , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , issued separate data compilations on Friday that confirmed the 2014 record . A Japanese agency had released preliminary information in early January showing 2014 as the warmest year .\n\nOne more scientific group , in Britain , that curates the world ’ s temperature record is scheduled to report in the coming weeks .\n\nSeparate temperature measurements taken from satellites do not show 2014 as a record year , although it is close . Several scientists said the satellite readings reflected temperatures in the atmosphere , not at the earth ’ s surface , so it was not surprising that they would differ slightly from the ground and ocean-surface measurements that showed record warmth .\n\n“ Why do we keep getting so many record-warm years ? ” Dr. Schmidt asked in an interview . “ It ’ s because the planet is warming . The basic issue is the long-term trend , and it is not going away . ”\n\nFebruary 1985 was the last time global surface temperatures fell below the 20th-century average for a given month , meaning that no one younger than 30 has ever lived through a below-average month . The last full year that was colder than the 20th-century average was 1976 .\n\nThe contiguous United States set a temperature record in 2012 , a year of scorching heat waves and drought . But , mostly because of the unusual chill in the East , 2014 was only the 34th warmest year on record for the lower 48 states .\n\nThat cold was drawn into the interior of the country by a loop in a current called the jet stream that allowed Arctic air to spill southward . But an offsetting kink allowed unusually warm tropical air to settle over the West , large parts of Alaska and much of the Arctic .\n\nA few recent scientific papers say that such long-lasting kinks in the jet stream have become more likely because global warming is rapidly melting the sea ice in the Arctic , but many leading scientists are not convinced on that point .\n\nWhatever the underlying cause , last year ’ s extreme warmth in the West meant that Alaska , Arizona , California and Nevada all set temperature records . Some parts of California essentially had no winter last year , with temperatures sometimes running 10 to 15 degrees above normal for the season . The temperature in Anchorage , Alaska ’ s largest city , never fell below zero in 2014 , the first time that has happened in 101 years of record-keeping for the city .\n\nTwenty years of global negotiations aimed at slowing the growth of heat-trapping emissions have yielded little progress . However , 2014 saw signs of large-scale political mobilization on the issue , as more than 300,000 people marched in New York City in September , and tens of thousands more took to the streets in other cities around the world .\n\nThe next big attempt at a global climate agreement will come when negotiators from around the world gather in Paris in December . Political activists on climate change wasted no time Friday in citing the 2014 heat record as proof that strong action was needed .\n\n“ The steady and now record-breaking rise in average global temperatures is not an issue for another day , ” Michael R. Bloomberg , the former New York mayor who is spending tens of millions of dollars of his personal fortune to battle climate change , said in a statement . “ It ’ s a clear and present danger that poses major economic , health , environmental and geopolitical risks . ”", "label": [[4913, 5044, "Circular Reasoning"], [3069, 3204, "Intentional"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/science/earth/2014-was-hottest-year-on-record-surpassing-2010.html#:~:text=Christy%2C%20an%20atmospheric%20scientist%20at,error%20margin%20of%20global%20temperature", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-justin-gillis-2014-breaks-heat-record/"}
{"id": 878, "data": "For the first time on record , precipitation on Saturday at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level — fell as rain and not snow .\n\nTemperatures at the Greenland summit over the weekend rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade . The warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet , enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington , DC , nearly 250,000 times .\n\nIt was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950 , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center , and the amount of ice mass lost on Sunday was seven times higher than the daily average for this time of year .\n\nTed Scambos , a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado , said this is evidence Greenland is warming rapidly .\n\n'What is going on is not simply a warm decade or two in a wandering climate pattern ' Scambos told CNN . 'This is unprecedented .

A major UN climate report released this month concluded that the burning of fossil fuels led to Greenland melting over the past two decades . A recent study published in the journal Cryosphere found Earth has lost a staggering 28 trillion tonnes of ice since the mid-1990s , a large portion of which was from the Arctic , including the Greenland ice sheet .\n\nIn July , the Greenland ice sheet experienced one of the most significant melting events in the past decade , losing more than 8.5 billion tons of surface mass in a single day , which was enough to submerge Florida in two inches of water . It was the third instance of extreme melting in the past decade , during which time the melting has stretched farther inland than the entire satellite era , which began in the 1970s .\n\nIn 2019 , Greenland shed roughly 532 billion tons of ice into the sea . During that year , an unexpectedly hot spring and a July heat wave caused almost the entire ice sheet 's surface to begin melting . Global sea level rose permanently by 1.5 millimeters as a result .\n\nA crucial ocean circulation is showing signs of instability .

The bear had trekked several hundred miles inland across the ice sheet . In the last five years , Mercer said three polar bears have been sighted high on Greenland 's ice sheet .\n\nAccording to Mercer , the rain will have a lasting effect on the properties of the snow , leaving a crust of ice behind that will absorb more energy from the sun , until it gets buried by snow . Scambos said this crusty layer will also be a barrier that prevents the downward draining of melt water , which will then flood the surface of the ice sheet and initiate run off at higher elevations .\n\nBecause of the layer of ice it created , the weekend 's rainfall event 'will be visible in ice core records in the future , ' Mercer said .", "label": [[2865, 2914, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3841, 3899, "Faulty Generalization"], [3771, 4174, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [365, 441, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3306, 3359, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/19/weather/greenland-summit-rain-climate-change/index.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/rain-fell-on-greenland-summit-for-the-first-time-on-record-as-accurately-reported-by-cnn/"}
