Earlier , they had tended to imagine creeping shifts occurring over many millennia . But by the late 1990s , they accepted that abrupt transitions , tipping points , could occur .

This didn ’ t bode well for humanity ’ s warming of the atmosphere . Dr. Broecker , who died in 2019 , famously warned : “ The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks . ”

WHY DID THE AMOC shut down ? A leading theory is that meltwater from retreating glaciers emptied into the North Atlantic or Arctic oceans . Freshwater is lighter than saltwater , and the sudden influx of more buoyant water could have impeded the sinking of denser , saltier water — that critical “ overturning ” phase of the AMOC .","[6500, 6569, 'Logical Fallacy']"

He points out that , in IPCC jargon , “ very unlikely ” translates to a probability of less than 10 percent . But if a nuclear reactor in your neighborhood had a less-than-10-percent likelihood of blowing up , he asked , “ would you be reassured ? ”

“ We still don ’ t know how far away this threshold is where it could break down altogether , ” he said . If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — a goal of the Paris agreement among nations to fight climate change — a shutdown is unlikely , he thinks . “ But for unmitigated warming , ” which is the world ’ s current trajectory , “ I think there ’ s increasing risk where we make AMOC so weak it goes over the edge and collapses . ”","[10066, 10277, 'Logical Fallacy']"

Should we trust these computer models of doom ? Let ’ s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be .

Atmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings . NASA honored him for this achievement , and he was an author for a previous edition of the U.N. report . He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly .","[877, 900, 'Ad Hominem']"

He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly .

Christy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics . The result ? In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere , the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed . Overprediction also occurred at all other levels . Christy recently concluded that , on average , the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed .

This is a critical error . Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide .

Christy is not looking at surface temperatures , as measured by thermometers at weather stations . Instead , he is looking at temperatures measured from calibrated thermistors carried by weather balloons and data from satellites . Why didn ’ t he simply look down here , where we all live ? Because the records of the surface temperatures have been badly compromised .

Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900 : a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century , before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it , and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century .","[2591, 2650, 'Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)']"

He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly .

Christy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics . The result ? In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere , the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed . Overprediction also occurred at all other levels .

But the author of that study — who just happened to be the same IPCC lead author who injected it into the report — later admitted his claim was incorrect , and when the study was finally published , denied the connection .

In 2012 , the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Weather came out and echoed the Hohenkammer Consensus , concluding that once you adjust for population growth and economic changes , there is no statistical connection between climate change and measures of weather-related damages . In 2013 Pielke testified to the United States Congress and relayed the IPCC findings . Shortly thereafter , Obama ’ s science advisor John Holdren accused him of misleading Congress and launched a lengthy but ill-informed attack on Pielke , which prompted congressional Democrats to open an investigation into Pielke ’ s sources of funding ( which quickly fizzled amid benign conclusions ) . Meanwhile heavily funded left-wing groups succeeded in getting him fired from a popular internet news platform . In 2015 Pielke quit the climate field .

But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology . The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “ enigma ” ; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle .

It is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water , the so-called steric component . But by studying a very short time interval , it is possible to sidestep most of the complications , like “ isostatic adjustment ” of the shoreline ( as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted ) and “ subsidence ” of the shoreline ( as ground water and minerals are extracted ) .","[210, 338, 'Fallacy of Credibility']"

I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45 , when a genuine , independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred . I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming ; it continues at the same rate , 1.8 millimeters a year , according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr . I therefore conclude—contrary to the general wisdom—that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise . That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide .

This conclusion is worth highlighting : It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels . The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise .","[1106, 1231, 'Logical Fallacy']"

The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges , many of which have been collecting data for over a century .

The cause of the trend is a puzzle . Physics demands that water expand as its temperature increases . But to keep the rate of rise constant , as observed , expansion of sea water evidently must be offset by something else . What could that be ? I conclude that it must be ice accumulation , through evaporation of ocean water , and subsequent precipitation turning into ice . Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries .

It is difficult to explain why evaporation of seawater produces approximately 100 % cancellation of expansion . My method of analysis considers two related physical phenomena : thermal expansion of water and evaporation of water molecules . But if evaporation offsets thermal expansion , the net effect is of course close to zero .

But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology . The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “ enigma ” ; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle .

It is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water , the so-called steric component . But by studying a very short time interval , it is possible to sidestep most of the complications , like “ isostatic adjustment ” of the shoreline ( as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted ) and “ subsidence ” of the shoreline ( as ground water and minerals are extracted ) .

I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45 , when a genuine , independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred . I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming ; it continues at the same rate , 1.8 millimeters a year , according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr . I therefore conclude—contrary to the general wisdom—that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise .

All this , because it is much warmer now than 12,000 years ago , at the end of the most recent glaciation . Yet there is little heat available in the Antarctic to support melting .

We can see melting happening right now at the Ross Ice Shelf of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .

But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000 , or about 26,000 , up slightly from 20,000-25,000 , or about 22,500 , in 2005 . Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total .

211,http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/polar-bears-keep-thriving-even-as-global-warming-alarmists-keep-pretending-theyre-dying,"One powerful polar bear fact is slowly rising above the message of looming catastrophe repeated endlessly by the media : More than 15,000 polar bears have not disappeared since 2005 . Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050 , the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn ’ t happen . Rather , global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved . The polar bear ’ s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom , but it didn ’ t . The alarmism is not going away without a struggle .

Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science . My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers . For example , Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart , depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet . But that fact , documented in more than a dozen scientific papers , is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology . In these days of politicized science , neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea ; instead , they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice , which they argued depleted the bears ’ prey . There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16 , with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming .","[290, 368, 'Fallacy of Extension (straw man)']"

One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup ( now at Polar Bears International , an NGO ) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice , despite the Beaufort Sea experience . Moreover , Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear ’ s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears ’ prey .

Consequently , many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals ( the primary prey of polar bears ) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season , which is particularly conducive to fishing : These seals do most of their feeding in summer . More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’ s probably true throughout the Arctic .","[2105, 2219, 'Fallacy of Credibility']"
213,http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/polar-bears-keep-thriving-even-as-global-warming-alarmists-keep-pretending-theyre-dying,"Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year . The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year , the isolated nature of the incident , and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously .

That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world .

Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night , dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area .","[362, 533, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"

So it ’ s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reported Tuesday that the first half of 2017 was the second-warmest January-June on record for Earth , topped only by 2016 , which was boosted by one of the biggest El Niños on record .

“ As if it wasn ’ t shocking enough to see three consecutive record-breaking years , in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , for the first time on record , ” leading climatologist Michael Mann wrote in an email to ThinkProgress , “ we ’ re now seeing near-record temperatures even in the absence of the El Nino ‘ assist ’ that the previous record year benefited from . ”","[186, 315, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"

The latest NOAA report is “ a reminder that climate change has not , despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘ paused ’ or even slowed down , ” Mann said .

It is , I promise , worse than you think . If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise , you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible , even within the lifetime of a teenager today . And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming , and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic , that they have occluded our perception of other threats , many much closer at hand . Rising oceans are bad , in fact very bad ; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough .

Indeed , absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives , parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable , and other parts horrifically inhospitable , as soon as the end of this century .","[99, 291, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"
289,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html,"Even when we train our eyes on climate change , we are unable to comprehend its scope . This past winter , a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole , melting the permafrost that encased Norway ’ s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “ Doomsday , ” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe , and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built .

The Doomsday vault is fine , for now : The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe . But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news . Until recently , permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists , because , as the name suggests , it was soil that stayed permanently frozen . But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon , more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth ’ s atmosphere . When it thaws and is released , that carbon may evaporate as methane , which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century ; when judged on the timescale of two decades , it is 86 times as powerful . In other words , we have , trapped in Arctic permafrost , twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet , all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up , partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over .

Maybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day , like those , last month , that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought ( in fact , the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines ) . Or the news from Antarctica this past May , when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days , then kept going ; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this , it may already have met the open water , where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever , a process known poetically as “ calving . ”","[1813, 1882, 'False Dilemma']"

But no matter how well-informed you are , you are surely not alarmed enough . Over the past decades , our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias , perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety , and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers , we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination . The reasons for that are many : the timid language of scientific probabilities , which the climatologist James Hansen once called “ scientific reticence ” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was ; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn ’ t even see warming as a problem worth addressing ; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings ; the simple speed of change and , also , its slowness , such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past ; our uncertainty about uncertainty , which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible ; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere , not everywhere ; the smallness ( two degrees ) and largeness ( 1.8 trillion tons ) and abstractness ( 400 parts per million ) of the numbers ; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult , if not impossible , to solve ; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem , which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation ; simple fear . But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial , too .

In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself . This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us . That is what Wallace Smith Broecker , the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “ global warming , ” means when he calls the planet an “ angry beast. ” You could also go with “ war machine. ” Each day we arm it more .","[8641, 8933, 'Fallacy of Credibility']"

At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still .

Ice works that way , too , as a climate ledger , but it is also frozen history , some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen . There are now , trapped in Arctic ice , diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases , since before humans were around to encounter them . Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice .

The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times . In Alaska , already , researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world ’ s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone . As the BBC reported in May , scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice , too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness , left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun .

Experts caution that many of these organisms won ’ t actually survive the thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already reanimated several of them — the 32,000-year-old “ extremophile ” bacteria revived in 2005 , an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007 , the 3.5 million–year–old one a Russian scientist self-injected just out of curiosity — to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the return of such ancient plagues . But already last year , a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier ; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected , too , carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra .","[19026, 19236, 'Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)']"

What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated , rewired , or even re-evolved by warming . The first effect is geographical . Before the early-modern period , when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs , human provinciality was a guard against pandemic . Today , even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations , our ecosystems are mostly stable , and this functions as another limit , but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did . You don ’ t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France . But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them , you will . You didn ’ t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago , either .

As it happens , Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation . One reason you hadn ’ t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda ; another is that it did not , until recently , appear to cause birth defects . Scientists still don ’ t entirely understand what happened , or what they missed . But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases : Malaria , for instance , thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do , too , but because for every degree increase in temperature , the parasite reproduces ten times faster . Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050 , 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it .","[20628, 20793, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"

Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria . They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war , it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming ; next door , for instance , Lebanon suffered the same crop failures . But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence : For every half-degree of warming , they say , societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict . In climate science , nothing is simple , but the arithmetic is harrowing : A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today . Overall , social conflict could more than double this century .

This is one reason that , as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out , the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change : The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough , but being the world ’ s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles . Of course , it ’ s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict . Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global warming — a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the region ’ s oil .","[25570, 25659, 'False Causality']"

By comparison , the Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent , in a onetime shock ; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse .

The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend , but you can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an economy half as big , which would produce only half as much value , generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world . It makes the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically small economic potatoes . And , among other things , it makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business calculation .

Barring a radical reduction of emissions , we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century . A third of the world ’ s major cities are on the coast , not to mention its power plants , ports , navy bases , farmlands , fisheries , river deltas , marshlands , and rice-paddy empires , and even those above ten feet will flood much more easily , and much more regularly , if the water gets that high . At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today .

But the drowning of those homelands is just the start . At present , more than a third of the world ’ s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God , or else we ’ d have that much more warming already . But the result is what ’ s called “ ocean acidification , ” which , on its own , may add a half a degree to warming this century . It is also already burning through the planet ’ s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place . You have probably heard of “ coral bleaching ” — that is , coral dying — which is very bad news , because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people . Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly , too , though scientists aren ’ t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat ; they do know that in acid waters , oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells , and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans ’ pH has over the past generation , it induces seizures , comas , and sudden death .

That isn ’ t all that ocean acidification can do . Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “ anoxic , ” first in deep ocean “ dead zones , ” then gradually up toward the surface . There , the small fish die out , unable to breathe , which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive , and the feedback loop doubles back . This process , in which dead zones grow like cancers , choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries , is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia , where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “ Skeleton Coast. ” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry , but today it ’ s more apt than ever .

II . Heat Death","[9905, 10008, 'Faulty Generalization']"

Humans , like all mammals , are heat engines ; surviving means having to continually cool off , like panting dogs . For that , the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant , drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping . At seven degrees of warming , that would become impossible for large portions of the planet ’ s equatorial band , and especially the tropics , where humidity adds to the problem ; in the jungles of Costa Rica , for instance , where humidity routinely tops 90 percent , simply moving around outside when it ’ s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal . And the effect would be fast : Within a few hours , a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out .

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before , but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow , even by the standards of planetary history . At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .","[10509, 10682, 'Faulty Generalization']"

Sometime during our careers , we ’ re going to see these things beginning to happen. ’ ”

Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi ’ s famous paradox , which asks , If the universe is so big , then why haven ’ t we encountered any other intelligent life in it ? The answer , they suggested , is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years , and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred . In a universe that is many billions of years old , with star systems separated as much by time as by space , civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another . Peter Ward , a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet ’ s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas , calls this the “ Great Filter ” : “ Civilizations rise , but there ’ s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly , ” he told me . “ If you look at planet Earth , the filtering we ’ ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions. ” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun ; so much more dying is coming .

And yet , improbably , Ward is an optimist . So are Broecker and Hansen and many of the other scientists I spoke to . We have not developed much of a religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us , or give us purpose , in the face of possible annihilation . But climate scientists have a strange kind of faith : We will find a way to forestall radical warming , they say , because we must .","[41818, 42064, 'Intentional']"

The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us . That is what Wallace Smith Broecker , the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “ global warming , ” means when he calls the planet an “ angry beast. ” You could also go with “ war machine. ” Each day we arm it more .

II . Heat Death","[9423, 9784, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"

For that , the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant , drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping . At seven degrees of warming , that would become impossible for large portions of the planet ’ s equatorial band , and especially the tropics , where humidity adds to the problem ; in the jungles of Costa Rica , for instance , where humidity routinely tops 90 percent , simply moving around outside when it ’ s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal . And the effect would be fast : Within a few hours , a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out .

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before , but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow , even by the standards of planetary history . At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still .

At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

Actually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit . As soon as several decades from now , the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year .

333,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html,"Climates differ and plants vary , but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming , yields decline by 10 percent . Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent . Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century , we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them . And proteins are worse : It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat , butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts .

Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature , and they are right — theoretically , a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland . But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown , the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain , and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity . And you can ’ t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles , because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there ; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt .

Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat , with some of the world ’ s most arable land turning quickly to desert . Precipitation is notoriously hard to model , yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous : unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced . By 2080 , without dramatic reductions in emissions , southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought , much worse than the American dust bowl ever was . The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East ; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia , Africa , and South America ; and the breadbasket regions of China . None of these places , which today supply much of the world ’ s food , will be reliable sources of any . As for the original dust bowl : The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s , a 2015 NASA study predicted , but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300 , which “ dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains ” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization .","[15922, 16098, 'Faulty Generalization']"

Remember , we do not live in a world without hunger as it is . Far from it : Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million globally .

Rock , in the right spot , is a record of planetary history , eras as long as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just inches , or just an inch , or even less . Ice works that way , too , as a climate ledger , but it is also frozen history , some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen . There are now , trapped in Arctic ice , diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases , since before humans were around to encounter them . Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice .

The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times . In Alaska , already , researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world ’ s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone . As the BBC reported in May , scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice , too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness , left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun .","[18350, 18645, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"

But already last year , a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier ; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected , too , carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra .

What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated , rewired , or even re-evolved by warming . The first effect is geographical . Before the early-modern period , when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs , human provinciality was a guard against pandemic . Today , even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations , our ecosystems are mostly stable , and this functions as another limit , but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did . You don ’ t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France . But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them , you will . You didn ’ t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago , either .

As it happens , Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation . One reason you hadn ’ t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda ; another is that it did not , until recently , appear to cause birth defects . Scientists still don ’ t entirely understand what happened , or what they missed . But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases : Malaria , for instance , thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do , too , but because for every degree increase in temperature , the parasite reproduces ten times faster . Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050 , 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it .","[20192, 20625, 'Logical Fallacy']"

What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict ?

Heat increases municipal crime rates , and swearing on social media , and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher , coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch , will hit an opposing batter in retaliation .

In Miami-Dade County , developers had 1.6 million sq ft ( 149,000 sq m ) of office space and 1.8 million of retail space under construction in the second quarter of 2016 alone . Sunny Isles Beach , home to 20,300 people , has eight high-rise buildings under construction ; swing a seagull in the air , and you ’ ll hit a crane . As you might imagine , the value of development in this sun-soaked part of the country is high , too . Property in Sunny Isles alone is now worth more than $ 10 billion . Many of the wealthiest people in the US reside in Florida , including 40 billionaires on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans ; on a recent week , the most expensive real estate listing in the US was a $ 54 million mansion in Palm Beach .

Despite his history of referring to climate change as a “ hoax ” and his recent rollback of emissions-slashing initiatives , President Donald Trump is one of these property owners with a stake in the issue . The president frequently visits his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach , 75 miles ( 121km ) north of Miami , which is itself an area experiencing flooding from high tides . There also are six Trump-branded residential buildings in Sunny Isles , one of which still provides the president with income , and a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood .

Look beyond all the glass and steel , though , and – despite the federal government ’ s sidelining of the issue – there ’ s another thrum of activity . It ’ s the wastewater treatment plant constructing new buildings five feet higher than the old ones . The 105 miles ( 169km ) of roads being raised in Miami Beach . The new shopping mall built with flood gates . The 116 tidal valves installed in Fort Lauderdale . The seawalls being raised and repaired . And the worried conversations between more and more residents every year about what the sea-rise models predict – and what to do about it .","[5052, 5219, 'Fallacy of Credibility']"

Everything ’ s going to change . And that ’ s particularly going to be exacerbated in coastal communities .

“ This would be no different than if I came to you and said ‘ Hey , in 40 years , gravity ’ s going to change . I can ’ t tell you exactly what it ’ s going to be . But let ’ s assume roughly between 50 % and 80 % stronger or weaker than it is now. ’ You ’ d look around and say ‘ Shoot , what ’ s that going to affect ? ’

`` And the answer is : it affects everything . ”","[7436, 7686, 'Logical Fallacy']"
408,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170403-miamis-fight-against-sea-level-rise,"The most dramatic impacts may not be felt for 50 or 100 years . But coastal communities are already experiencing more storms and extremely high tides known as king tides . In the same study , Wdowinski found there were a total of 16 flood events in Miami Beach from 1998 to 2005 . From 2006 to 2013 , there were 33 .

Although the timing of king tides results from the positions of the Sun , Moon and Earth , rising seas heighten their effect . At extreme high tides , water levels have surged to an inch below the Intracoastal Waterway , says Jennifer Jurado , Broward County ’ s chief resiliency officer . “ Once that ’ s breached , you ’ re open to the ocean – the supply of water is endless . The system is really at capacity . These are flood conditions , even with just the high tide and supermoon… You see men in business suits trying to trudge through water . ”

Even without floods , the rising water table affects everything . The cities here are built on porous limestone . The water doesn ’ t just come over seawalls ; it seeps up from beneath the streets . Nearly 90 % of the drinking water in south Florida comes from aquifers , and these are finding their fresh water pushed further and further inland as the salt water exerts more and more pressure . Take Hallandale Beach , a small city of just under 40,000 residents . Saltwater already has breached five of the eight freshwater wells that the city draws from , says Vice Mayor Keith London . And around a quarter of Miami-Dade residents use septic tanks . If these don ’ t remain above the water table , the result could be thoroughly unpleasant .","[12707, 12962, 'Faulty Generalization']"

Ocean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start . In 2004 , two NOAA scientists , Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine , produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels . But then , just over a year ago , Mike Wallace , a hydrologist with 30 years ’ experience , noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information . Their chart only started in 1988 but , as Wallace knew , there were records dating back to at least 100 years before .

452,http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/ocean-acidification-yet-another-wobbly-pillar-of-climate-alarmism/,"Even if the oceans were ‘ acidifying ’ , though , it wouldn ’ t be a disaster for a number of reasons — as recently outlined in a paper by Patrick Moore for the Frontier Centre for Public Policy . First , marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels ; second , they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change ; third , seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH ; fourth , if oceans do become warmer due to ‘ climate change ’ , the effect will be for them to ‘ outgas ’ CO2 , not absorb more of it .

Finally , and perhaps most damningly , Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life . The impact on calcification , metabolism , growth , fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units ( beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century ) is beneficial , not damaging . Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification .

Given all this , you might well ask why our learned institutions , government departments and media outlets have put so much effort into pretending otherwise . Why , between 2009 and 2014 , did Defra spend a whopping £12.5 million on an ocean acidification research programme when the issue could have been resolved , for next to nothing , after a few hours ’ basic research ?","[5543, 5775, 'False Causality']"

To those of us who have been studying the global warming scare in some detail , the answer is depressingly obvious . It ’ s because in the last decade or so , the climate change industry has become so vast and all encompassing , employing so many people , it simply can not be allowed to fail .

According to a report last year by Climate Change Business Journal , it ’ s now worth an astonishing $ 1.5 trillion — about the same as the online shopping industry . If the scare goes away , then all bets are off , because the entire global decarbonisation business relies on it . The wind parks , the carbon sequestration projects , the solar farms , the biomass plantations — none of these green schemes make any kind of commercial sense unless you buy into the theory that anthropogenic CO2 is catastrophically warming the planet and that radical green measures , enforced by governmental regulation , must be adopted to avert it .","[6343, 6520, 'Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)']"

The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large . As that demand for energy grows , the amount of renewable energy also has to grow , just to maintain only a 15-20 % fraction of the total .

So , until people actually experience climate change , and new energy technologies are developed , any claims by politicians that we are in a “ climate crisis ” will fall on deaf ears . And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty , if we allow policymakers to have their way , the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren .

How is that possible ? It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area . However , there is a process of accretion , where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand , counteracting the reduction in land mass . Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise , leading to net land-area gain .

This is not only true for the Marshall Islands . The researchers write that within the “ recently emerging body of shoreline change studies on atoll islands there is little evidence of widespread reef island erosion . To the contrary , several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [ growth ] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century , resulting in a net increase in island area. ” The most famous of these studies , published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji , showed that of 27 Pacific islands , 14 % lost area .

He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink . He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001 . His book , A Farewell to Ice , tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate .

You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade . It hasn ’ t . Are you being alarmist ?
No . There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover . However , each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away . The overall trend is a very strong downward one , however . Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic ’ s summer sea-ice cover . Next year or the year after that , I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free . You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship . There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline . Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018 .

It is 23 times more powerful . However , methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide . It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years . By contrast , carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100 years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed . At least that is what scientists thought . Today , there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere .

So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away . But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect . All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere . We are having to live with last century ’ s carbon dioxide . What that says is simple : there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide .

I am a bit suspicious of this technology . BECCS will need so much land to be effective . Calculations suggest it would need 40 % to 50 % of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants . Other techniques , such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks , which absorb carbon dioxide , on beaches , will simply not scale up . They won ’ t work , so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly .

As far as I can see , it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end . It can be done , I am sure , but at the moment we do not have such a device . However , without something like that I can not see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere . We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed . That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us .

We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century , it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent .","[469, 531, 'Ad Populum']"
535,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/no-one-ever-says-it-but-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-a-go/,"As global warming pushes temperatures up , more people will die in heat waves ; a point emphasized by campaigners like UN climate chief , Christiana Figueres . What we don ’ t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold . One study for England and Wales shows that heat kills 1,500 annually and cold kills 32,000 . By the 2080s , increased heat-waves will kill nearly 5,000 in a comparable population . But ‘ cold deaths ’ will have dropped by 10,000 , meaning 6,500 fewer die altogether .

Only mentioning the negatives distorts and degrades the political conversation . Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour . It is an extreme partisan that insists either side offers only negatives .

Yet , this is the position enforced by the climate alarmists – last seen in a letter to The Times from Lord Krebs and company , essentially telling the newspaper to stop reporting less-than-negative climate stories . While it is true any individual news story rarely represents the whole truth , it is revealing that such campaigners don ’ t send out similar letters to correct the daily deluge of alarmist stories .","[1834, 1912, 'Faulty Generalization']"
536,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/no-one-ever-says-it-but-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-a-go/,"As the world develops , it has become much less vulnerable : a hurricane hitting Florida kills few people while a similar event in Guatemala kills tens of thousands . Indeed , climate-related deaths have dropped from half a million per year in the 1920s to less than 25,000 per year in the 2010s . A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP , because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience .

When the BBC warns of melting glaciers it is reminiscent of Al Gore ’ s concern that 40 per cent of the world get drinking water from the Himalayas , and melting glaciers mean “ those 40 per cent of the people on Earth are going to face a very serious shortage. ” Yet , a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases . Indeed , water flow will actually increase over this century , which is likely beneficial in increasing “ water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons . ”

If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad , we would have a much better understanding of our options . Climate economics does just that , taking all the negatives ( like rising sea levels and more heat deaths ) and all the positives ( a greener planet , fewer cold deaths ) . A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists ’ massive insistence on negatives-only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits . Over time , climate becomes a net problem : by the 2070s , the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP . This is certainly not a trivial cost , but nor is it the end of the world . It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today .","[3713, 3875, 'Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)']"
537,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/no-one-ever-says-it-but-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-a-go/,"This suggests that a policy which could eradicate global warming for 1 per centof global GDP would probably be a good deal . Unfortunately , we do not have such a deal on the table . The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem . Less effective but more ambitious climate policies cost at least 6 per cent of global GDP per year and likely much more . Wind and solar , which covers less than half of one percent of global energy , costs dozens of times more than their climate benefits . Electric cars provide perhaps a thousandth in climate benefit of their substantial public subsidies . Biofuels are just hugely costly while increasing emissions .

When we shift the climate conversation to describe positives along with negatives , and focus on costs and benefits of policies – essentially treating this challenge like any other policy agenda – it becomes obvious how many of today ’ s accepted climate policies are poor . Little wonder climate campaigners do not want this sort of conversation .","[5881, 5952, 'Ad Hominem']"

Lyme Disease is much more common in northern , cooler regions of the United States than in southern , warmer regions . Asserting , without any supporting data or evidence , that a disease that prospers in cool climates will become more prevalent as a result of global warming defies objective data and common sense . Moreover , a team of scientists extensively researched Lyme Disease climate and habitat and reported in the peer-reviewed science journal EcoHealth , “ the only environmental variable consistently association with increased [ Lyme Disease ] risk and incidence was the presence of forests . ”

Granted , alarmists can argue that forests are thriving under global warming , with the result that forest-dwelling ticks will also benefit . However , expanding forests are universally – and properly – viewed as environmentally beneficial . Alarmist attempts to frame thriving forests as harmful perfectly illustrate the alarmists ’ proclivity to claim anything and everything – no matter how beneficial – is severely harmful and caused by global warming .","[3234, 3429, 'False Dilemma']"

Outbreaks of “ new or resurgent diseases ” are occurring precisely because governments have caved in to environmental activist groups like EDF and implemented their anti-science agendas . For example , DDT had all but eliminated malaria in the United States and on the global stage during the mid-20th century . However , environmental activists championed false environmental accusations against DDT and dramatically reduced use of the life-saving mosquito killer throughout much of the world . As a result , malaria has reemerged with a vengeance and millions of people die every year as a result .

Also , as documented above in “ Alarmist Assertion # 2 , ” global warming will reduce the impact and death toll of cold-related viruses such as influenza . In the United States alone , influenza kills 36,000 people every year , which dwarfs all heat-dependent viruses and diseases combined . Few people other than global warming alarmists would argue that it is better to have 36,000 people die each year from influenza than have a few people die each year from Lyme Disease ( which , as documented above , isn ’ t even related to global warming ) .","[16040, 16225, 'False Causality']"

Calling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet , while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet , is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists . Icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet every year , with or without global warming , particularly in the Antarctic summer . However , a particular iceberg – no matter how large – breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet does not necessarily result in “ Shrinking Glaciers ” as EDF alleges . To the contrary , the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been growing at a steady and substantial pace ever since NASA satellites first began measuring the Antarctic ice sheet in 1979 . Indeed , during the same year that the EDF claims “ an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago ” broke off the Antarctic ice sheet and caused “ Shrinking Glaciers , ” the Antarctic ice sheet repeatedly set new records for its largest extent in recorded history . Those 2013 records were repeatedly broken again in 2014 . The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history , and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking .

The EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs .

By early Friday morning , the storm was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in either the eastern Pacific or entire North Atlantic basin , which also includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean . It 's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near-record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms . It 's also an area where atmospheric conditions were favorable for such a storm to strengthen . [ seealso url= '' http : //mashable.com/2015/10/23/hurricane-patricia-mexico/ '' ] Consider this : As of 5 a.m . ET on Thursday , the storm had 85 mile-per-hour winds and a minimum central air pressure of 980 millibars . By 5 a.m . ET on Friday , the winds increased to 200 miles per hour , with an air pressure of 880 millibars . That 's an astonishing 100 millibar drop in air pressure in a 24-hour period , which is virtually unheard of . The intensification rate looked like a steep staircase when graphed using a satellite-based computer algorithm that tracks storm intensity .

Some snapshots : In just the past few months , record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people . In Washington state ’ s Olympic National Park , the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory . London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K. ; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated . In California , suffering from its worst drought in a millennium , a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours , jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic . Then , a few days later , the region was pounded by intense , virtually unheard-of summer rains . Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean , shifting weather patterns worldwide .

On July 20th , James Hansen , the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public ’ s attention in the summer of 1988 , issued a bombshell : He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted : 10 feet by 2065 . The authors included this chilling warning : If emissions aren ’ t cut , “ We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable . Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating . It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable , threatening the fabric of civilization . ”

Eric Rignot , a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen ’ s study , said their new research doesn ’ t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise , it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss , especially among world leaders . In particular , says Rignot , the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “ safe ” level of climate change — “ would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise . ”","[1609, 1783, 'Faulty Generalization']"

In particular , says Rignot , the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “ safe ” level of climate change — “ would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise . ”

Hansen ’ s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be . Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history , some parts of the ocean , near where ice is melting exceptionally fast , are actually cooling , slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy . Sure enough , a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland , exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be . Michael Mann , another prominent climate scientist , recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown , “ This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding . ”

Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures , the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound . Storms will get stronger , and sea-level rise will accelerate . Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come , though Mann said it was still “ unclear ” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon .","[2493, 2881, 'False Causality']"

Every two weeks , Bill Peterson , an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’ s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon , takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon . What he ’ s been seeing this year is deeply troubling .

Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet . A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon , which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs . The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn ’ t exist without salmon .

But their situation is precarious . This year , officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks , because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving . One species , the winter-run Chinook salmon , is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years , should the warm water persist offshore .","[6132, 6447, 'Logical Fallacy']"

Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years , during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO . It also makes big El Niños , like this year ’ s , more likely . The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven ’ t yet figured out precisely what ’ s behind them and why they happen when they do . It ’ s not a permanent change — the ocean ’ s temperature will likely drop from these record highs , at least temporarily , some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting , and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview .

“ The climate [ change ] models predict this gentle , slow increase in temperature , ” says Peterson , “ but the main problem we ’ ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high . As scientists , we can ’ t keep up with it , and neither can the animals. ” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round : “ At some point , you knock them down , and the fight is over . ”

Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean ’ s food chain . In July , another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “ quite traumatic ” impact on plankton diversity , with some species dying out while others flourish . As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , it ’ s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines . According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT , that trend means “ the whole food chain is going to be different . ”","[8129, 8420, 'Logical Fallacy']"

In a 2-degree world , hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding as a result of climate change . Asia , namely East , Southeast , and South Asia will be particularly affected . Unfortunately , some of these regions which will face the largest and most immediate impacts from rising seas have the fewest resources to combat them . In many cases , the cost of coastal adaptation may be too much , flooding from storms pushing higher water levels into homes will become too frequent , or the intrusion of saltwater into the local water table will make growing crops impossible – and people in all regions of the world will be forced to leave their homes and cities .","[7558, 7873, 'Fallacy of Emotion']"
638,https://mashable.com/archive/vanuatu-cyclone-pam-global-warming,"According to Trenberth , about about 0.6 degrees Celsius , or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit , of the ocean temperature anomalies `` can be blamed on human-induced global warming '' while the rest is `` natural '' and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean . El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean . It can alter worldwide weather patterns , including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans . Whatever the cause , though , the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam , as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air . `` The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20 % more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had . The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size , '' Trenberth said in an email conversation . `` The winds are stronger , the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels . '' El Niño `` has played a role here on top of global warming . But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway ( but not this strong ) . The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven 's sake , '' he said . An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948 , although there are considerable uncertainties in this data , says Michael Ventrice , an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts . He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects .

`` The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified , '' Ventrice said .

639,https://mashable.com/archive/vanuatu-cyclone-pam-global-warming,"Climate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to . However , the Southwest Pacific , where Cyclone Pam occurred , is not one of these areas , possibly due to the relative paucity of data there . Kerry Emanuel , a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes , told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu .

`` Ironically , this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics , and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming , '' he said in an email . In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18 , Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing , even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse . `` While Pam and Haiyan , as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters , can not be uniquely pinned on global warming , they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms , '' Emanuel said . Tom Knutson , a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones , the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century . In fact , there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there , based on the most recent computer model simulations , Knutson says . James Elsner , a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth , says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger , like storms elsewhere . But the data is not yet there to prove it . `` We have a pretty solid basis ( physical & empirical ) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger , '' he said . `` Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic . But the signal is hard to see in noisy data , and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones . '' Although global warming signals may not be present yet , multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones ( including hurricanes and typhoons ) to be more intense , on average , than they are today , which means these storms will be more destructive . Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades , according to peer reviewed research . Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding , this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today . As a small , low-lying island nation , Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming . Along with other small island countries , some of which were affected by the same cyclone , Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change , seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation .
