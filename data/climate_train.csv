But the result is what ’ s called “ ocean acidification , ” which , on its own , may add a half a degree to warming this century . It is also already burning through the planet ’ s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place . You have probably heard of “ coral bleaching ” — that is , coral dying — which is very bad news , because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people . Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly , too , though scientists aren ’ t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat ; they do know that in acid waters , oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells , and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans ’ pH has over the past generation , it induces seizures , comas , and sudden death .

That isn ’ t all that ocean acidification can do . Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “ anoxic , ” first in deep ocean “ dead zones , ” then gradually up toward the surface . There , the small fish die out , unable to breathe , which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive , and the feedback loop doubles back . This process , in which dead zones grow like cancers , choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries , is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia , where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “ Skeleton Coast. ” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry , but today it ’ s more apt than ever .

The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history , and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking .

The EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs . Moreover , opening up more of the Earth ’ s surface to vegetation and plant and animal life would normally be considered a beneficial change , if global warming alarmists had not so thoroughly politicized the global warming discussion .

Global warming alarmists ’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year ( to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year ) in the United States alone . This appalling death toll occurs every year even while wind power produces just 3 % of U.S. electricity . Ramping up wind power to 10 , 20 , or 30 % of U.S. electricity production would likely increase annual bat kills to 10-to-30 million every year . Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense .

Just as importantly , alarmists present no evidence that global warming caused the summer heat wave in a notoriously hot desert near the equator . To the contrary , climate change theory and objective data show our recent global warming is occurring primarily in the winter , toward the poles , and at night .",fallacy of extension

But already last year , a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier ; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected , too , carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra .

What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated , rewired , or even re-evolved by warming . The first effect is geographical . Before the early-modern period , when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs , human provinciality was a guard against pandemic . Today , even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations , our ecosystems are mostly stable , and this functions as another limit , but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did . You don ’ t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France . But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them , you will . You didn ’ t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago , either .

As it happens , Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation . One reason you hadn ’ t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda ; another is that it did not , until recently , appear to cause birth defects . Scientists still don ’ t entirely understand what happened , or what they missed . But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases : Malaria , for instance , thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do , too , but because for every degree increase in temperature , the parasite reproduces ten times faster .

You see , many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement aren ’ t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries .

Gina McCarthy , who ran the agency under President Obama , bewailed the danger global warming poses “ to all of us who call Earth home , ” and said she couldn ’ t “ imagine what additional information [ Pruitt ] might want from scientists ” in order to understand that .

Yet for all the hyperventilating , Pruitt ’ s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate ’ s “ primary control knob ” — was entirely sound . “ We don ’ t know that yet , ” he said . We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred .

Climate economics does just that , taking all the negatives ( like rising sea levels and more heat deaths ) and all the positives ( a greener planet , fewer cold deaths ) . A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists ’ massive insistence on negatives-only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits . Over time , climate becomes a net problem : by the 2070s , the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP . This is certainly not a trivial cost , but nor is it the end of the world . It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today .

This suggests that a policy which could eradicate global warming for 1 per centof global GDP would probably be a good deal . Unfortunately , we do not have such a deal on the table . The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem . Less effective but more ambitious climate policies cost at least 6 per cent of global GDP per year and likely much more .

The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle , the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day . Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows , and the cows will convert the beans to meat , and the humans will eat the meat . In the process , the cows will emit much greenhouse gas , and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat , meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people .

This inefficient process happens on a massive scale . Brazil , the world ’ s largest exporter of red meat , holds around 212 million cattle . ( In June , the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses , collections of pus , in the meat . ) According to the United Nations , 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock .

Yet for all the hyperventilating , Pruitt ’ s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate ’ s “ primary control knob ” — was entirely sound . “ We don ’ t know that yet , ” he said . We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred .

And while it ’ s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice .

Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year . The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year , the isolated nature of the incident , and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously .

That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world .

First , marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels ; second , they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change ; third , seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH ; fourth , if oceans do become warmer due to ‘ climate change ’ , the effect will be for them to ‘ outgas ’ CO2 , not absorb more of it .

Finally , and perhaps most damningly , Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life .

If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad , we would have a much better understanding of our options .

In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement , the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven ’ t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don ’ t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe , and why we haven ’ t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “ the environmental uncanny. ” “ Consider , for example , the stories that congeal around questions like , ‘ Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell ? ’ or ‘ Where were you on 9/11 ? ’ ” he writes . “ Will it ever be possible to ask , in the same vein , ‘ Where were you at 400 ppm ? ’ or ‘ Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up ? ’ ” His answer : Probably not , because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves , especially in novels , which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate .

Surely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it . In a six-degree-warmer world , the Earth ’ s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “ weather ” : a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts , the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations . The strongest hurricanes will come more often , and we ’ ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them ; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently , and hail rocks will quadruple in size . Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future ; going forward , we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past . Early naturalists talked often about “ deep time ” — the perception they had , contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin , of the profound slowness of nature . What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “ dreamtime , ” or “ everywhen ” : the semi-mythical experience , described by Aboriginal Australians , of encountering , in the present moment , an out-of-time past , when ancestors , heroes , and demigods crowded an epic stage . You can find it already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea — a feeling of history happening all at once .

It is . Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and economic debt , accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and now come due after several centuries — a helpful perspective , in a way , since it is the carbon-burning processes that began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that followed . But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades ; since the end of World War II , the figure is 85 percent . Which means that , in the length of a single generation , global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe , and that the story of the industrial world ’ s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime . My father ’ s , for instance : born in 1938 , among his first memories the news of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that followed , films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American industrial might ; and among his last memories the coverage of the desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news , ten weeks before he died of lung cancer last July . Or my mother ’ s : born in 1945 , to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives were incinerated , now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity paradise , a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized developing world .

Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) .

As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still .

Outbreaks of “ new or resurgent diseases ” are occurring precisely because governments have caved in to environmental activist groups like EDF and implemented their anti-science agendas . For example , DDT had all but eliminated malaria in the United States and on the global stage during the mid-20th century . However , environmental activists championed false environmental accusations against DDT and dramatically reduced use of the life-saving mosquito killer throughout much of the world . As a result , malaria has reemerged with a vengeance and millions of people die every year as a result .

Also , as documented above in “ Alarmist Assertion # 2 , ” global warming will reduce the impact and death toll of cold-related viruses such as influenza . In the United States alone , influenza kills 36,000 people every year , which dwarfs all heat-dependent viruses and diseases combined .

For that , the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant , drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping . At seven degrees of warming , that would become impossible for large portions of the planet ’ s equatorial band , and especially the tropics , where humidity adds to the problem ; in the jungles of Costa Rica , for instance , where humidity routinely tops 90 percent , simply moving around outside when it ’ s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal . And the effect would be fast : Within a few hours , a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out .

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before , but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow , even by the standards of planetary history . At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) .

The Environmental Protection Agency uses social cost of carbon models that rely on the model-based ECS estimates . Last year , two colleagues and I published a study in which we took an earlier Lewis and Curry ECS estimate and plugged it into two of those models . The result was that the estimated economic damages of greenhouse gas emissions fell by between 40 and 80 per cent , and in the case of one model the damages had a 40 per cent probability of being negative for the next few decades — that is , they would be beneficial changes . The new Lewis and Curry ECS estimate is even lower than their old one , so if we re-did the same study we would find even lower social costs of carbon .

If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests , it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised . It also means that greenhouse gas emissions do not have as big an impact on the climate as has been claimed , and the case for costly policy measures to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions is much weaker than governments have told us .

Before the early-modern period , when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs , human provinciality was a guard against pandemic . Today , even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations , our ecosystems are mostly stable , and this functions as another limit , but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did . You don ’ t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France . But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them , you will . You didn ’ t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago , either .

As it happens , Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation . One reason you hadn ’ t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda ; another is that it did not , until recently , appear to cause birth defects . Scientists still don ’ t entirely understand what happened , or what they missed . But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases : Malaria , for instance , thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do , too , but because for every degree increase in temperature , the parasite reproduces ten times faster . Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050 , 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it .",appeal to emotion

Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us . That is what Wallace Smith Broecker , the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “ global warming , ” means when he calls the planet an “ angry beast. ” You could also go with “ war machine. ” Each day we arm it more .

Pollen is a product and mechanism of plant reproduction and growth . As such , pollen counts will rise and fall along with plant health and vegetation intensity . Any increase in pollen will be the result of a greener biosphere with more plant growth . Similar to the alarmist argument , discussed above , that expanding forests will create more habitat for the ticks that spread Lyme Disease , alarmists here are taking overwhelmingly good news about global warming improving plant health and making it seem like this good news is actually bad news because healthier plants mean more pollen .

Indeed , NASA satellite instruments have documented a spectacular greening of the Earth , with foliage gains most prevalent in previously arid , semi-desert regions . For people experiencing an increase in vegetation in previously barren regions , this greening of the Earth is welcome and wonderful news . For global warming alarmists , however , a greener biosphere is terrible news and something to be opposed . This , in a nutshell , defines the opposing sides in the global warming debate . Global warming alarmists claim a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is horrible and justifies massive , economy-destroying energy restrictions .

“ As predictable as the sunrise , some will say heat waves always happened , ” said Marshall Shepherd , director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society . “ Yep , so did home runs in baseball , but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs .

Gina McCarthy , who ran the agency under President Obama , bewailed the danger global warming poses “ to all of us who call Earth home , ” and said she couldn ’ t “ imagine what additional information [ Pruitt ] might want from scientists ” in order to understand that .

Yet for all the hyperventilating , Pruitt ’ s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate ’ s “ primary control knob ” — was entirely sound . “ We don ’ t know that yet , ” he said . We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred .

Calling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet , while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet , is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists . Icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet every year , with or without global warming , particularly in the Antarctic summer . However , a particular iceberg – no matter how large – breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet does not necessarily result in “ Shrinking Glaciers ” as EDF alleges . To the contrary , the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been growing at a steady and substantial pace ever since NASA satellites first began measuring the Antarctic ice sheet in 1979 . Indeed , during the same year that the EDF claims “ an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago ” broke off the Antarctic ice sheet and caused “ Shrinking Glaciers , ” the Antarctic ice sheet repeatedly set new records for its largest extent in recorded history . Those 2013 records were repeatedly broken again in 2014 . The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history , and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking .

The EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs . Moreover , opening up more of the Earth ’ s surface to vegetation and plant and animal life would normally be considered a beneficial change , if global warming alarmists had not so thoroughly politicized the global warming discussion .",fallacy of relevance

However , the Southwest Pacific , where Cyclone Pam occurred , is not one of these areas , possibly due to the relative paucity of data there . Kerry Emanuel , a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes , told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu .

`` Ironically , this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics , and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming , '' he said in an email . In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18 , Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing , even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse . `` While Pam and Haiyan , as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters , can not be uniquely pinned on global warming , they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms , '' Emanuel said . Tom Knutson , a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones , the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century . In fact , there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there , based on the most recent computer model simulations , Knutson says . James Elsner , a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth , says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger , like storms elsewhere . But the data is not yet there to prove it . `` We have a pretty solid basis ( physical & empirical ) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger , '' he said . `` Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic . But the signal is hard to see in noisy data , and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones . '' Although global warming signals may not be present yet , multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones ( including hurricanes and typhoons ) to be more intense , on average , than they are today , which means these storms will be more destructive . Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades , according to peer reviewed research . Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding , this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today . As a small , low-lying island nation , Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming . Along with other small island countries , some of which were affected by the same cyclone , Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change , seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation .

Any attempt to connect a warmer climate to an increase in Lyme Disease must be accompanied by an acknowledgement of a warmer climate ’ s propensity to reduce influenza incidence and mortality .

The cause of the trend is a puzzle . Physics demands that water expand as its temperature increases . But to keep the rate of rise constant , as observed , expansion of sea water evidently must be offset by something else . What could that be ? I conclude that it must be ice accumulation , through evaporation of ocean water , and subsequent precipitation turning into ice . Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries .

It is difficult to explain why evaporation of seawater produces approximately 100 % cancellation of expansion .

Over the past decades , our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias , perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety , and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers , we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination . The reasons for that are many : the timid language of scientific probabilities , which the climatologist James Hansen once called “ scientific reticence ” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was ; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn ’ t even see warming as a problem worth addressing ; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings ; the simple speed of change and , also , its slowness , such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past ; our uncertainty about uncertainty , which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible ; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere , not everywhere ; the smallness ( two degrees ) and largeness ( 1.8 trillion tons ) and abstractness ( 400 parts per million ) of the numbers ; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult , if not impossible , to solve ; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem , which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation ; simple fear . But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial , too .

In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself . This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency . But those scenarios , and not the present climate , are the baseline . In fact , they are our schedule .

The present tense of climate change — the destruction we ’ ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough . Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *",appeal to emotion

This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency . But those scenarios , and not the present climate , are the baseline . In fact , they are our schedule .

The present tense of climate change — the destruction we ’ ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough . Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .",fallacy of credibility

It can alter worldwide weather patterns , including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans .

To understand why , we first need to delve into the methodology a bit . There are two ways scientists try to estimate ECS . The first is to use a climate model , double the modeled CO2 concentration from the pre-industrial level , and let it run until temperatures stabilize a few hundred years into the future . This approach , called the model-based method , depends for its accuracy on the validity of the climate model , and since models differ quite a bit from one another , it yields a wide range of possible answers . A well-known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method . It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees , possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower , and possibly as high as nine degrees . This range of potential warming is very influential on economic analyses of the costs of climate change .

The second method is to use long-term historical data on temperatures , solar activity , carbon-dioxide emissions and atmospheric chemistry to estimate ECS using a simple statistical model derived by applying the law of conservation of energy to the planetary atmosphere . This is called the Energy Balance method . It relies on some extrapolation to satisfy the definition of ECS but has the advantage of taking account of the available data showing how the actual atmosphere has behaved over the past 150 years .",intentional

By 2050 , according to the U.S. Forest Service , wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today ; in some places , the area burned could grow fivefold . What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions , especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat . Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997 , for instance , added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent , and more burning only means more warming only means more burning . There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon , which in 2010 suffered its second “ hundred-year drought ” in the space of five years , could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating , rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest .

Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change . It does not . The role of the sun and clouds was not considered important by modellers . They are the major drivers for the climate on our planet .

We emit a trace atmospheric gas called carbon dioxide at a time in planetary history of low atmospheric carbon dioxide . The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas . Just because we are alive today does not mean we change major planetary systems that operated for billions of years . Earth ’ s climate dances to rhythms every day , every season and on far larger lunar , ocean , solar , orbital , galactic and tectonic cycles . Climate change is normal and continual . When cycles overlap , climate change can be rapid and large . Sporadic events such as supernovas and volcanic eruptions can also change climate .

The main greenhouse gas is water vapour . It is the only gas in air that can evaporate , humidify and condense into clouds that precipitate rain , hail and snow . These processes involve a transfer of energy , and water vapour makes the atmosphere behave like a giant airconditioner . Carbon dioxide is a non-condensable atmospheric gas like nitrogen and oxygen .

Calling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet , while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet , is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists . Icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet every year , with or without global warming , particularly in the Antarctic summer . However , a particular iceberg – no matter how large – breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet does not necessarily result in “ Shrinking Glaciers ” as EDF alleges . To the contrary , the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been growing at a steady and substantial pace ever since NASA satellites first began measuring the Antarctic ice sheet in 1979 . Indeed , during the same year that the EDF claims “ an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago ” broke off the Antarctic ice sheet and caused “ Shrinking Glaciers , ” the Antarctic ice sheet repeatedly set new records for its largest extent in recorded history . Those 2013 records were repeatedly broken again in 2014 . The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history , and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking .

The EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs .

Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi ’ s famous paradox , which asks , If the universe is so big , then why haven ’ t we encountered any other intelligent life in it ? The answer , they suggested , is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years , and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred . In a universe that is many billions of years old , with star systems separated as much by time as by space , civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another . Peter Ward , a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet ’ s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas , calls this the “ Great Filter ” : “ Civilizations rise , but there ’ s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly , ” he told me . “ If you look at planet Earth , the filtering we ’ ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions. ” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun ; so much more dying is coming .

Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria . They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war , it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming ; next door , for instance , Lebanon suffered the same crop failures . But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence : For every half-degree of warming , they say , societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict . In climate science , nothing is simple , but the arithmetic is harrowing : A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today . Overall , social conflict could more than double this century .

This is one reason that , as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out , the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change : The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough , but being the world ’ s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles . Of course , it ’ s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict .

This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency . But those scenarios , and not the present climate , are the baseline . In fact , they are our schedule .

The present tense of climate change — the destruction we ’ ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough . Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .",intentional

Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050 , the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn ’ t happen . Rather , global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved . The polar bear ’ s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom , but it didn ’ t . The alarmism is not going away without a struggle .

Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science . My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers . For example , Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart , depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet . But that fact , documented in more than a dozen scientific papers , is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology . In these days of politicized science , neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea ; instead , they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice , which they argued depleted the bears ’ prey . There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16 , with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming .",intentional

First , marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels ; second , they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change ; third , seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH ; fourth , if oceans do become warmer due to ‘ climate change ’ , the effect will be for them to ‘ outgas ’ CO2 , not absorb more of it .

Finally , and perhaps most damningly , Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life . The impact on calcification , metabolism , growth , fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units ( beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century ) is beneficial , not damaging . Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification .

Alarmist attempts to frame thriving forests as harmful perfectly illustrate the alarmists ’ proclivity to claim anything and everything – no matter how beneficial – is severely harmful and caused by global warming .

Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050 , the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn ’ t happen . Rather , global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved . The polar bear ’ s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom , but it didn ’ t . The alarmism is not going away without a struggle .

Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science . My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers . For example , Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart , depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet . But that fact , documented in more than a dozen scientific papers , is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology . In these days of politicized science , neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea ; instead , they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice , which they argued depleted the bears ’ prey . There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16 , with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming .",fallacy of extension

At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

Actually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit . As soon as several decades from now , the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year .

It is not just the hajj , and it is not just Mecca ; heat is already killing us . In the sugarcane region of El Salvador , as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease , including over a quarter of the men , the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago . With dialysis , which is expensive , those with kidney failure can expect to live five years ; without it , life expectancy is in the weeks .

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is essential to plant life , and adding more of it to the atmosphere enhances plant growth and crop production . Longer growing seasons and fewer frost events also benefit plant growth and crop production . As this column has repeatedly documented ( see articles here , here , and here , for example ) , global crops set new production records virtually every year as our planet modestly warms . If crop shortages cause national security threats and global warming increases crop production , then global warming benefits rather than jeopardizes national security .

The same holds true for water supplies . Objective data show there has been a gradual increase in global precipitation and soil moisture as our planet warms . Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans , which in turn stimulates more frequent precipitation over continental land masses .

At that concentration , compared to the air we breathe now , human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent .

Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier , with small increases in pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years . The warmer the planet gets , the more ozone forms , and by mid-century , Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog , the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected . By 2090 , as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “ safe ” level ; one paper last month showed that , among other effects , a pregnant mother ’ s exposure to ozone raises the child ’ s risk of autism ( as much as tenfold , combined with other environmental factors ) . Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in West Hollywood .

Already , more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning ; each year , 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke , in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season ( in the U.S. , it ’ s increased by 78 days since 1970 ) . By 2050 , according to the U.S. Forest Service , wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today ; in some places , the area burned could grow fivefold . What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions , especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat . Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997 , for instance , added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent , and more burning only means more warming only means more burning . There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon , which in 2010 suffered its second “ hundred-year drought ” in the space of five years , could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating , rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest .

If crop shortages cause national security threats and global warming increases crop production , then global warming benefits rather than jeopardizes national security .

The same holds true for water supplies . Objective data show there has been a gradual increase in global precipitation and soil moisture as our planet warms . Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans , which in turn stimulates more frequent precipitation over continental land masses . The result of this enhanced precipitation is an improvement in soil moisture at almost all sites in the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank .

Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us . That is what Wallace Smith Broecker , the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “ global warming , ” means when he calls the planet an “ angry beast. ” You could also go with “ war machine. ” Each day we arm it more .",fallacy of logic

Consequently , many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals ( the primary prey of polar bears ) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season , which is particularly conducive to fishing : These seals do most of their feeding in summer . More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’ s probably true throughout the Arctic .

As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring , they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast .

The Doomsday vault is fine , for now : The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe . But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news . Until recently , permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists , because , as the name suggests , it was soil that stayed permanently frozen . But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon , more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth ’ s atmosphere . When it thaws and is released , that carbon may evaporate as methane , which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century ; when judged on the timescale of two decades , it is 86 times as powerful . In other words , we have , trapped in Arctic permafrost , twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet , all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up , partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over .

This is called the Energy Balance method .

The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates . The accompanying chart compares the model-based range to ECS estimates from a dozen Energy Balance studies over the past decade . Clearly these two methods give differing answers , and the question of which one is more accurate is important .

Climate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy . One is called the “ emergent constraint ” approach . The idea is that models yield a range of ECS values , and while we can ’ t measure ECS directly , the models also yield estimates of a lot of other things that we can measure ( such as the reflectivity of cloud tops ) , so we could compare those other measures to the data , and when we do , sometimes the models with high ECS values also yield measures of secondary things that fit the data better than models with low ECS values .",intentional

It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases . More formally , it is defined as the increase , in degrees Celsius , of average temperatures around the world , after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change . The reason it ’ s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change .

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius , but it can ’ t be more precise than that . Which is too bad , because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value . People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say , less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and , in many places , mildly beneficial . If it is very low , for instance around one , it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about . But if ECS is high — say , around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem . We may not be able to stop it , but we ’ d better get ready to adapt to it .

Over the past decades , our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias , perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety , and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers , we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination . The reasons for that are many : the timid language of scientific probabilities , which the climatologist James Hansen once called “ scientific reticence ” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was ; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn ’ t even see warming as a problem worth addressing ; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings ; the simple speed of change and , also , its slowness , such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past ; our uncertainty about uncertainty , which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible ; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere , not everywhere ; the smallness ( two degrees ) and largeness ( 1.8 trillion tons ) and abstractness ( 400 parts per million ) of the numbers ; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult , if not impossible , to solve ; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem , which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation ; simple fear . But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial , too .

In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself . This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response .

One would expect that the government overseers would simply report the raw data that was collected .

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us .

In particular , says Rignot , the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “ safe ” level of climate change — “ would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise . ”

Hansen ’ s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be . Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history , some parts of the ocean , near where ice is melting exceptionally fast , are actually cooling , slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy . Sure enough , a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland , exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be . Michael Mann , another prominent climate scientist , recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown , “ This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding . ”

Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures , the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound . Storms will get stronger , and sea-level rise will accelerate . Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come , though Mann said it was still “ unclear ” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon .",false causality

Also , it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years .

Nor can it be the consequences of this recent slight temperature increase that worries world leaders . On a global scale , as scientists keep confirming , there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms , floods or droughts , while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer , thanks to modern technology and infrastructure .

And while it ’ s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice .

Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year . The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year , the isolated nature of the incident , and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously .

That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world . But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000 , or about 26,000 , up slightly from 20,000-25,000 , or about 22,500 , in 2005 . Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total . This increase may not be statistically significant , but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed .",faulty generalization

Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us .

By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest .

With dialysis , which is expensive , those with kidney failure can expect to live five years ; without it , life expectancy is in the weeks .

One would expect that the government overseers would simply report the raw data that was collected .

At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit . As soon as several decades from now , the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year .

With dialysis , which is expensive , those with kidney failure can expect to live five years ; without it , life expectancy is in the weeks . Of course , heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys , too . As I type that sentence , in the California desert in mid-June , it is 121 degrees outside my door .

This storm , like others that have come before it -- from a massive deluge that flooded Oklahoma City to a flooding event in Houston , both of which occurred earlier this year -- are examples of how the atmosphere is behaving in new ways now that there 's more water vapor and heat for weather systems to work with .

The issue now is that these events are even more severe than they otherwise would have been . And they are becoming more frequent in many areas . Though there are significant limits on what climate scientists can say at this point about an event like the South Carolina floods , it 's well-established that global warming has already led to a measurable increase in global atmospheric water vapor levels , and this moisture can be wrung out as heavier bursts of rain or snow . It is also well-established in scientific literature that precipitation is increasingly falling in short , intense bursts rather than long-lasting , generally lighter events .

The risk for extreme precipitation events is increasing in many parts of the world . One study , for example , showed that a 1-in-100 year winter-rainfall event in parts of the United Kingdom is already occurring more frequently , becoming a 1-in-80 year event .

Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us .

Actually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit .

Outbreaks of “ new or resurgent diseases ” are occurring precisely because governments have caved in to environmental activist groups like EDF and implemented their anti-science agendas .

However , environmental activists championed false environmental accusations against DDT and dramatically reduced use of the life-saving mosquito killer throughout much of the world .

Also , as documented above in “ Alarmist Assertion # 2 , ” global warming will reduce the impact and death toll of cold-related viruses such as influenza .

The polar bear ’ s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom , but it didn ’ t . The alarmism is not going away without a struggle .

Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science . My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers . For example , Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart , depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet . But that fact , documented in more than a dozen scientific papers , is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology . In these days of politicized science , neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea ; instead , they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice , which they argued depleted the bears ’ prey . There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16 , with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming .

This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency . But those scenarios , and not the present climate , are the baseline . In fact , they are our schedule .

The present tense of climate change — the destruction we ’ ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough . Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .",ad populum

Intervening cold periods brought crop failure , famine , and mass depopulation . History advises us to welcome warmth and fear cold .

Modestly warming temperature and increasing carbon dioxide lead to longer growing seasons and more productive harvests .

This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency . But those scenarios , and not the present climate , are the baseline . In fact , they are our schedule .

The present tense of climate change — the destruction we ’ ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough . Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .",faulty generalization

What made all this particularly absurd was that , despite being led by an Australian scientist , they were so taken in by the make-believe that they seemed quite oblivious to the satellite records showing that Antarctic sea-ice had long been expanding to such record levels that these more than matched any decline in the Arctic ice at the other end of the world . But wasn ’ t the whole point of this warming that it was meant to be “ global ” ?

Of course , the reason why they have all wanted the ice at the poles to melt , not least on the land in Antarctica and Greenland , is that this would bring about their ultimate scare scenario : those sea levels rising by as much as 20 feet , which , as Al Gore showed in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth , would flood New York , Shanghai and many of the world ’ s most populous cities .",intentional
93,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-great-failure-of-the-climate-models,"Atmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings . NASA honored him for this achievement , and he was an author for a previous edition of the U.N. report . He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly .

Christy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics . The result ? In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere , the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed . Overprediction also occurred at all other levels . Christy recently concluded that , on average , the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed .

This is a critical error . Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide . Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean , and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere . That ’ s important . Most of Earth ’ s agriculture is dependent upon the transfer of moisture from the tropics to temperate regions .",intentional

This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey ’ s strangest and scariest behaviors . The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall , achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast . This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico : It may be unique .

They then cooled down a bit , only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’ 90s , about the same amount as earlier in the century .

Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at . Until last June , most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s , and since then had plateaued in a “ hiatus. ” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature .

That changed last summer , when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) decided to overhaul its data , throwing out satellite-sensed sea-surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on , among other sources , readings taken from the cooling-water-intake tubes of oceangoing vessels . The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship ’ s infrastructure conducts heat , absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun ’ s energy , and vessels ’ intake tubes are at different ocean depths .

The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “ denier ” driven by “ unreason. ” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt ’ s views “ extreme ” and “ irresponsible ” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA . Gina McCarthy , who ran the agency under President Obama , bewailed the danger global warming poses “ to all of us who call Earth home , ” and said she couldn ’ t “ imagine what additional information [ Pruitt ] might want from scientists ” in order to understand that .

Yet for all the hyperventilating , Pruitt ’ s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate ’ s “ primary control knob ” — was entirely sound . “ We don ’ t know that yet , ” he said . We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred . It should go without saying that if scientists can not yet make accurate predictions about future climate change , then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete .",ad hominem

Several scientists said the satellite readings reflected temperatures in the atmosphere , not at the earth ’ s surface , so it was not surprising that they would differ slightly from the ground and ocean-surface measurements that showed record warmth .

“ Why do we keep getting so many record-warm years ? ” Dr. Schmidt asked in an interview . “ It ’ s because the planet is warming . The basic issue is the long-term trend , and it is not going away . ”

February 1985 was the last time global surface temperatures fell below the 20th-century average for a given month , meaning that no one younger than 30 has ever lived through a below-average month . The last full year that was colder than the 20th-century average was 1976 .",circular reasoning

Climate economics does just that , taking all the negatives ( like rising sea levels and more heat deaths ) and all the positives ( a greener planet , fewer cold deaths ) . A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists ’ massive insistence on negatives-only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits . Over time , climate becomes a net problem : by the 2070s , the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP . This is certainly not a trivial cost , but nor is it the end of the world . It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today .

This suggests that a policy which could eradicate global warming for 1 per centof global GDP would probably be a good deal . Unfortunately , we do not have such a deal on the table . The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem . Less effective but more ambitious climate policies cost at least 6 per cent of global GDP per year and likely much more . Wind and solar , which covers less than half of one percent of global energy , costs dozens of times more than their climate benefits . Electric cars provide perhaps a thousandth in climate benefit of their substantial public subsidies . Biofuels are just hugely costly while increasing emissions .

When we shift the climate conversation to describe positives along with negatives , and focus on costs and benefits of policies – essentially treating this challenge like any other policy agenda – it becomes obvious how many of today ’ s accepted climate policies are poor . Little wonder climate campaigners do not want this sort of conversation .",ad populum

For former president Barack Obama , the ever-changing and often contradictory `` facts '' about global warming ( which liberals now call climate change because the globe stopped warming ) was simply `` settled science . ''",intentional

Even with this year ’ s El Niño-boosted warmth threatening to break records , the world is barely half a degree Celsius ( 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than it was about 35 years ago . Also , it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years .

Nor can it be the consequences of this recent slight temperature increase that worries world leaders . On a global scale , as scientists keep confirming , there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms , floods or droughts , while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer , thanks to modern technology and infrastructure . Arctic sea ice has recently melted more in summer than it used to in the 1980s , but Antarctic sea ice has increased , and Antarctica is gaining land-based ice , according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology . Sea level continues its centuries-long slow rise—about a foot a century—with no sign of recent acceleration .

Perhaps it is the predictions that worry the world leaders . Here , we are often told by journalists that the science is “ settled ” and there is no debate . But scientists disagree : They say there is great uncertainty , and they reflected this uncertainty in their fifth and latest assessment for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer by the latter part of the century—that is , anything from mildly beneficial to significantly harmful .",intentional
