Compared with the last assessment in 2014 , 25 % of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million . This has shocked many veteran observers , because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s . “ That is a very deep concern , ” Johan Rockström , the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , said . “ Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science .","['intentional', 'intentional']"
192,"For 40 years , it has been around 3C . Now , we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought . ” He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating . “ We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [ above preindustrial levels ] . The best we could aim for is 2C , ” he said .",['faulty generalization']
193,"This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics . “ Clouds will determine humanity ’ s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with , ” said Palmer . “ Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse . ” In a recent paper in the journal Nature , Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather . This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models , but in the latest case , the results reinforced the estimates . “",['faulty generalization']
194,"The best we could aim for is 2C , ” he said . Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world ’ s leading climate research bodies , including the UK Met Office ’ s Hadley Centre and the EU ’ s Community Earth System Model . Timothy Palmer , a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office ’ s advisory board , said the high figure initially made scientists nervous . “ It was way outside previous estimates . People asked whether there was a bug in the code , ” he said . “ But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models . ”",['intentional']
195,"Timothy Palmer , a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office ’ s advisory board , said the high figure initially made scientists nervous . “ It was way outside previous estimates . People asked whether there was a bug in the code , ” he said . “ But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models . ” The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and , depending on altitude , droplet temperature and other factors , can play either a warming or a cooling role . For decades , this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes .",['appeal to emotion']
196,"While acknowledging the continued uncertainty , Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere . “ The more we learn , the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move , ” he said . “ It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy . ”",['fallacy of logic']
