{"id": 427, "data": "The Amazon rainforest is most likely now a net contributor to warming of the planet , according to a first-of-its-kind analysis from more than 30 scientists .\n\nFor years , researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures , drought , and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world ’ s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , and help offset emissions from fossil-fuel burning . Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store .\n\nBut the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle , the most species-rich on Earth , influences the global climate . Activities in the Amazon , both natural and human-caused , can shift the rainforest ’ s contribution in significant ways , warming the air directly or releasing other greenhouse gases that do .\n\nDrying wetlands and soil compaction from logging , for example , can increase emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide . Land-clearing fires release black carbon , small particles of soot that absorb sunlight and increase warmth . Deforestation can alter rainfall patterns , further drying and heating the forest . Regular flooding and dam-building releases the potent gas methane , as does cattle ranching , one chief reason forests are destroyed . And roughly 3.5 percent of all methane released globally comes naturally from the Amazon ’ s trees .\n\nYet no team had ever tried to assess the cumulative impact of these processes , even as the region is being rapidly transformed . The research , supported by the National Geographic Society and published today in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change , estimates that atmospheric warming from all of these sources combined now appears to swamp the forest ’ s natural cooling effect .\n\n“ Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake ; that ’ s a problem , ” says lead author Kristofer Covey , a professor of environmental studies at New York ’ s Skidmore College . “ But when you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2 , it gets really hard to see how the net effect isn ’ t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate . ”\n\nThe damage can still be reversed , he and his colleagues say . Halting global emissions from coal , oil , and natural gas would help restore balance , but curbing Amazon deforestation is a must , along with reducing dam building and increasing efforts to replant trees . Continuing to clear land at current rates appears certain to make warming worse for the entire world .\n\n“ We have this system that we have relied on to counter our mistakes , and we have really exceeded the capacity of that system to provide reliable service , ” says co-author Fiona Soper , an assistant professor at McGill University .\n\nA complicated ledger\nThe same richness that makes the Amazon so wonderfully biodiverse , home to tens of thousands of insects per square mile , makes understanding it extremely hard . Shimmering green leaves suck CO2 from the sky , converting it through photosynthesis into carbohydrates that end up in woody trunks and branches as trees grow . In trees and carbon-rich soils , the Amazon stores the equivalent of four or five years worth of human-made carbon emissions , up to 200 gigatons of carbon .\n\nBut the Amazon is also super wet , with floodwaters rising dozens of feet a year across the forest floor . Microbes in those drenched soils make methane , which is 28 to 86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 . Trees act like smokestacks , channeling that methane to the atmosphere .\n\nMeanwhile , moisture from the Atlantic Ocean that falls as rain gets sucked up by plants , used for photosynthesis , and exhaled by leaves through the same pores that take up CO2 . Back in the atmosphere , it falls as rain again .\n\nHumans complicate these natural cycles not just through climate change but through logging , reservoir-building , mining , and agriculture . Deforestation in Brazil has exploded in recent years , hitting a 12-year high in 2020 , increasing nearly 10 percent from the year before .\n\nSome of these processes draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere , while others cause the gases to rise , and they all influence one another . But until recently , no had attempted to understand that balance . “ It ’ s this system of interacting parts , and they ’ re all measured in different ways , on different time scales , by different people , ” Soper says .\n\n\nWhat ’ s clear is that the forest has been changing fast and in alarming ways . Rain now falls in massive bursts more frequently than it once did , triggering record floods . Droughts come more often and , in some areas , last longer . Trees that fare better in wet places are being outcompeted by tall , drought-tolerant species . Illegally set fires are on the rise again . About 5.4 million acres burned in 2019 , an area roughly the size of New Jersey .\n\nSo , in 2019 , the National Geographic Society brought Covey , Soper , and a team of other Amazon experts together to begin trying to dissect how all of these pieces fit together . They didn ’ t take new measurements—they looked for new ways to analyze existing data with an eye toward a comprehensive picture .\n\nLooking beyond CO2\nWhile the results include some uncertainty , they make clear that focusing on a single metric—CO2—simply doesn ’ t paint an accurate picture . “ As important as carbon is in the Amazon , it ’ s not the only thing that ’ s going on , ” says Tom Lovejoy , a senior fellow in biodiversity with the United Nations Foundation , who has worked in the Brazilian Amazon for decades . “ The only surprise , if you can call it that , is how much more there is when you add it all up . ”\n\nResource extraction , damming rivers , and the conversion of forest for soybean and livestock production all alter the natural systems in a variety of ways . But most serve to warm the climate . Methane is a particularly important player . While the largest sources of methane are still from natural forest processes , the Amazon ’ s capacity to take up carbon used to do far more to offset its methane emissions . Humans have diminished that capacity .\n\nRob Jackson , an earth systems scientist at Stanford University and a leading expert on global greenhouse emissions , considers the new research a worthwhile contribution . “ The Amazon is vulnerable , and we tend to get tunnel vision about one greenhouse gas alone , ” he says .\n\n\nPatrick Megonigal , associate director of research at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center , agreed . “ What the authors do that ’ s important is to expand the conversation beyond carbon dioxide , which is what 90 percent of public conversation is centered around , ” he says .\n\n“ CO2 is not a lone actor . When you consider the whole cast of other characters , the outlook in the Amazon is that the impacts of human activities will be worse than we realize . ”\n\nMany questions remain . The biggest for Megonigal is one that Lovejoy also worries about : How do all of these factors influence the local Amazon climate ? That ’ s important because the Amazon supplies much of its own moisture , with a single water molecule cycling through the forest five or more times as moist air moves from the Atlantic west over the continent .\n\nA recent analysis by Lovejoy and Carlos Nobre , a climate scientist with the University of São Paulo 's Institute for Advanced Studies , suggests that rising deforestation might so alter the flow of that moisture that it could push large stretches of the Amazon toward a permanent transition to a drier woodland savanna . The duo believes that tipping point could be reached if as little as 20 to 25 percent of the rainforest is cleared .\n\nThat would spell big trouble for the climate , substantially reducing even more the forests ’ potential to scrub the skies of some of our fossil-fuel emissions . By the Brazilian government ’ s own measure , forest clearing already tops 17 percent .\n\nWhat happens in Brazil ( and neighboring countries in the Amazon ) affects the whole world . In the United States , a group of environmental leaders from four previous presidential administrations , both Democratic and Republican—Bush senior , Clinton , Bush junior , and Obama—recently called on President Joe Biden to demand that Brazil ’ s government reduce deforestation . They urged Biden to use trade with the U.S. as leverage .\n\nBrazil and the U.S. are currently in negotiations .", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/amazon-rainforest-now-appears-to-be-contributing-to-climate-change", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/destruction-of-the-amazon-forest-very-likely-contributes-to-global-warming-as-accurately-described-in-the-national-geographic-article/"}
{"id": 428, "data": "IT ’ S ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST RIVERS you will never see , carrying some 30 times more water than all the world ’ s freshwater rivers combined . In the North Atlantic , one arm of the Gulf Stream breaks toward Iceland , transporting vast amounts of warmth far northward , by one estimate supplying Scandinavia with heat equivalent to 78,000 times its current energy use . Without this current — a heat pump on a planetary scale — scientists believe that great swaths of the world might look quite different .\n\nNow , a spate of studies , including one published last week , suggests this northern portion of the Gulf Stream and the deep ocean currents it ’ s connected to may be slowing . Pushing the bounds of oceanography , scientists have slung necklace-like sensor arrays across the Atlantic to better understand the complex network of currents that the Gulf Stream belongs to , not only at the surface , but hundreds of feet deep .\n\n“ We ’ re all wishing it ’ s not true , ” Peter de Menocal , a paleoceanographer and president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , said of the changing ocean currents . “ Because if that happens , it ’ s just a monstrous change . ”\n\nThe consequences could include faster sea level rise along parts of the Eastern United States and parts of Europe , stronger hurricanes barreling into the Southeastern United States , and perhaps most ominously , reduced rainfall across the Sahel , a semi-arid swath of land running the width of Africa that is already a geopolitical tinderbox .\n\nThe scientists ’ concern stems from their understanding of thousands of years of the prehistoric climate record . In the past , a great weakening or even shutdown of this arm of the Gulf Stream seems to have triggered rapid changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns around the North Atlantic and beyond .\n\nThe northern arm of the Gulf Stream is but one tentacle of a larger , ocean-spanning tangle of currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation , or AMOC . Scientists have strong evidence from ice and sediment cores that the AMOC has weakened and shut down before in the past 13,000 years . As a result , mean temperatures in parts of Europe may have rapidly dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius below today ’ s averages , ushering in arctic like conditions . Parts of northern Africa and northern South America became much drier . Rainfall may even have declined as far away as what is now China . And some of these changes may have occurred in a matter of decades , maybe less .\n\nThe AMOC is thus a poster child for the idea of climatic “ tipping points ” — of hard-to-predict thresholds in Earth ’ s climate system that , once crossed , have rapid , cascading effects far beyond the corner of the globe where they occur . “ It ’ s a switch , ” said Dr. de Menocal , and one that can be thrown quickly .\n\nWhich brings us to the cold blob . Almost everywhere around the world , average temperatures are rising — except southeast of Greenland where a large patch of the North Atlantic has become colder in recent years .\n\nIn short , the cold blob may signal that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream no longer arrives with the same strength to the North Atlantic . That a warming atmosphere has , paradoxically , cooled one part of the world .\n\nThe science remains relatively new , and not everyone agrees the AMOC is actually slowing . But in both scientific modeling of climate change and in the prehistoric record , a North Atlantic cooling presages a shutdown of the current . “ One of the hallmarks of a shutdown is this cold blob , ” says Dr. de Menocal . “ The cold blob is a big deal . ”\n\nIN 1513 , THE SPANISH EXPLORER Juan Ponce de León noticed something bizarre off the coast of today ’ s Florida : Relentless currents pushing his ships backward , overpowering the winds blowing them forward . He became the first European to describe the Gulf Stream . Benjamin Franklin finally mapped it in the late 1700s — he named it the “ Gulf Stream ” — by measuring changes in water temperature on a return trip from England .\n\nOver the 20th century , oceanographers came to realize that the northern branch of the Gulf Stream was part of a gigantic loop of water , with warm surface water flowing north and colder water returning south , deep below the surface . This was the network of currents that scientists now call the AMOC .\n\nThe system was driven by North Atlantic water that , as it lost heat to the atmosphere and grew dense , sank to the ocean ’ s depths , pulling warmer surface water northward . In the middle part of the century , oceanographer Henry Stommel elucidated the physics of how the AMOC could change . His insight was that , depending on the balance of heat and salinity , the sinking effect—called “ overturning ” —could strengthen , or weaken , or maybe stop completely .\n\nIn the 1980s , Wallace Broecker , a geochemist at Columbia University ’ s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory , pounced on that idea .\n\nColleagues studying ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet were seeing evidence of strange climatic “ flickers ” in the past . As Earth warmed from the deep freeze of the last ice age , which peaked around 22,000 years ago , temperatures would rise , then abruptly fall , then rise again just as swiftly . Dr. Broecker theorized this was caused by stops and starts in what he called the ocean ’ s “ great conveyor belt ” — the AMOC .\n\nThe clearest example began about 12,800 years ago . Glaciers that had once covered much of North America and Europe had retreated considerably , and the world was almost out of the deep freeze . But then , in just a few decades , Greenland and Western Europe plunged back into cold . Temperatures fell by around 10 degrees Celsius , or 18 degrees Fahrenheit , in parts of Greenland . Arctic-like conditions returned to parts of Europe .\n\nThe cold snap lasted perhaps 1,300 years — before reversing even more abruptly than it began . Scientists have observed the sudden changes in the pollen deposited at the bottom of European lakes and in changes in ocean sediments near Bermuda .\n\nThis forced a paradigm shift in how scientists thought about climate change . Earlier , they had tended to imagine creeping shifts occurring over many millennia . But by the late 1990s , they accepted that abrupt transitions , tipping points , could occur .\n\nThis didn ’ t bode well for humanity ’ s warming of the atmosphere . Dr. Broecker , who died in 2019 , famously warned : “ The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks . ”\n\nWHY DID THE AMOC shut down ? A leading theory is that meltwater from retreating glaciers emptied into the North Atlantic or Arctic oceans . Freshwater is lighter than saltwater , and the sudden influx of more buoyant water could have impeded the sinking of denser , saltier water — that critical “ overturning ” phase of the AMOC .\n\nToday we don ’ t have massive glacial lakes threatening to disgorge into the North Atlantic . But we do have the Greenland ice sheet , which is melting at the upper end of projections , or about six times faster than in the 1990s . And according to one study , the subpolar North Atlantic recently became less salty than at any time in the past 120 years .\n\nThere ’ s little agreement on cause . Changes in wind patterns or currents may be contributing , as could greater rainfall . But Stefan Rahmstorf , a physical oceanographer with the University of Potsdam in Germany , suspects that , similar to what happened some 12,800 years ago , meltwater from Greenland is beginning to slow the AMOC .\n\nIn 2014 , a remarkable project launched in the North Atlantic . An array of sophisticated sensors were moored to the ocean floor between Newfoundland , Greenland and Scotland . They ’ re starting to provide an unprecedented view of the currents that shape the Atlantic .\n\nIn 2015 , Dr. Rahmstorf and his colleagues published a seminal paper arguing that the AMOC had weakened by 15 percent in recent decades , a slowdown they said was unprecedented in the past 1,000 years . He and his colleagues recently published another paper that used additional reconstructions of sea temperature around the North Atlantic , some going back 1,600 years , to determine that the recent slowdown began with the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century , then accelerated after 1950 .\n\nOther scientists have also presented different evidence of a slowdown . The South Atlantic has become saltier in recent decades , according to a study by Chenyu Zhu at Ocean University of China and Zhengyu Liu at Nanjing Normal University , suggesting that more of the salt that once traveled north with the AMOC now remains in the tropics , producing what they call a “ salinity pile-up . ”\n\nAnd Christopher Piecuch of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution recently argued that the Gulf Stream along Florida ’ s coast , also called the Florida current , has weakened . He found this by measuring the differences in sea level across the Gulf Stream . Earth ’ s rotation deflects flowing water to the right ; this causes the two sides of the current to have slightly different sea levels — and the faster the current , the greater the difference . Tide gauge measurements going back 110 years indicate that this contrast has declined , Dr. Piecuch found , particularly in the past two decades . This suggests the current has slowed .\n\nFor Dr. Rahmstorf , these lines of evidence bolster the argument that the AMOC is slowing . In his view , the change is occurring right on schedule . “ The long-term trend is exactly what was predicted by the models , ” he said .\n\nA 2019 report by the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a synthesis of the most significant climate research worldwide , says that while the AMOC will “ very likely ” weaken later this century , collapse is “ very unlikely. ” Yet Dr. Rahmstorf worries about the unknowns in a system that scientists understand can rapidly shift between different states .\n\nHe points out that , in IPCC jargon , “ very unlikely ” translates to a probability of less than 10 percent . But if a nuclear reactor in your neighborhood had a less-than-10-percent likelihood of blowing up , he asked , “ would you be reassured ? ”\n\n“ We still don ’ t know how far away this threshold is where it could break down altogether , ” he said . If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — a goal of the Paris agreement among nations to fight climate change — a shutdown is unlikely , he thinks . “ But for unmitigated warming , ” which is the world ’ s current trajectory , “ I think there ’ s increasing risk where we make AMOC so weak it goes over the edge and collapses . ”\n\n“ There will be a lot of surprises if we disturb climate that much , ” he said . “ It ’ s not at all predictable how bad things will be . ”\n\nScientists also emphasize that the ultimate consequences of that weakening remain unclear . That ’ s in part because the world is in such uncharted territory . In the past , Europe became drastically cooler when the current shut down , but today any cooling might ultimately be muted or possibly canceled out by continued global heating .\n\nBut if past is prologue , a drastically altered AMOC could certainly shift rainfall patterns , scientists said , making parts of Europe and Northern Africa drier , and areas in the Southern hemisphere wetter . Changing ocean currents might affect marine ecosystems that people rely on for food and livelihood .\n\nA changing Gulf Stream could also accelerate sea-level rise along parts of the Atlantic coast of the United States . In 2009 and 2010 , when the stream inexplicably weakened by 30 percent , the Northeast saw seas rise at a rate unprecedented in the entire roughly 100-year record of tide gauges .\n\nAnd if water in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic becomes warmer because that heat is no longer shunted north , the expanding reservoir of energy could strengthen hurricanes , something that scientists at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom argue is already happening . Hurricanes derive their energy from heat in the water .\n\nFinally , in a perverse twist , a shutdown of the AMOC could exacerbate global heating . The ocean absorbs nearly one-third of human carbon dioxide emissions . But the sinking of salty , dense water — the overturning portion of the AMOC — is critical to that absorption . So , if the AMOC stops or greatly slows , and that water stops sinking , the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere could accelerate .\n\nTHEN THERE ARE THOSE CONSEQUENCES that fall in the category of “ global weirding . ”\n\nScientists at the U.K. ’ s National Oceanography Centre have somewhat counterintuitively linked the cold blob in the North Atlantic with summer heat waves in Europe . In 2015 and 2018 , the jet stream , a river of wind that moves from west to east over temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere , made an unusual detour to the south around the cold blob . The wrinkle in atmospheric flow brought hotter-than-usual air into Europe , they contend , breaking temperature records .\n\n“ That was not predicted , ” said Joel Hirschi , principal scientist at the centre and senior author of the research . It highlights how current seasonal forecasting models are unable to predict these warm summers . And it underscores the paradox that , far from ushering in a frigid future for , say , Paris , a cooler North Atlantic might actually make France ’ s summers more like Morocco ’ s .\n\nEven so , Dr. Hirschi takes a wait-and-see stance on whether the AMOC is actually slowing . “ I have great respect for what Dr. Rahmstorf is doing . And it may well be spot on in the end , ” he says . “ But I ’ m afraid the data , the really robust data , is not there . ”\n\nSusan Lozier , a physical oceanographer and dean at the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech , also has her doubts about whether the AMOC is currently slowing . At issue , she says , is how scientists infer changes in the AMOC . We can directly measure many aspects of the ocean , such as temperature ( it ’ s warming ) , oxygen levels ( they ’ re declining ) , even how stratified it has become ( more so ) . “ There are very strong signals in the ocean of climate change , ” she said .\n\nBut most studies on the AMOC don ’ t measure the “ conveyor belt ” directly . Instead , they use proxies to infer that the overturning has changed .\n\nSuch inference can be problematic when considering changes that occur over short time frames , says Dr. Lozier , because the changes observed could have other causes . Consider that cold blob in the North Atlantic , she said . Dr. Rahmstorf and others see it as evidence of a weakening Gulf Stream , but Dr. Lozier notes that shifts in wind patterns or how storms move over the ocean could also underlie the phenomenon . “ There are other ways to explain it , ” she said . “ A lot of our conceptual understanding of AMOC is in isolation of other things going on in the ocean . ”\n\nDirect measurement of the AMOC only began relatively recently . A line of sensors between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands , called Rapid , was installed in 2004 . A second sensor array , spanning the North Atlantic from Canada to Greenland to Scotland and called Osnap , went live in 2014 . ( Dr. Lozier is the international project lead for Osnap . )\n\nNeither project has operated long enough to produce clear trends , in Dr. Lozier ’ s view . What they have shown , though , is lots of natural variability . In 2009 and 2010 , for example , the AMOC weakened — “ people were like , ‘ Oh my God , this is happening , ’ ” she said — only to pick right back up again over the following years .\n\nThey ’ ve also revealed a system of currents that ’ s far more complex than once envisioned .\n\nDr. Broecker ’ s old schematics of the AMOC posit a neat warm current flowing north along the western edge of the Atlantic and an equally neat cold current flowing back south below it . In fact , says Dr. Lozier , that deeper current is not confined to the western edge of the Atlantic , but rather flows southward via a number of “ rivers ” that are filled with eddies . The network of deep ocean currents is much more complicated than once envisioned , in other words , and figuring out how buoyant meltwater from Greenland might affect the formation of cold deepwater has become more complicated as well .\n\nThis is the place scientists currently find themselves in . They suspect the AMOC can work like a climate switch . They ’ re watching it closely . Some argue that it ’ s already changing , others that it ’ s too soon to tell .\n\n“ There ’ s no consensus on whether it has slowed to date , or if it ’ s currently slowing , ” said Dr. Lozier . “ But there is a consensus that if we continue to warm the atmosphere , it will slow . ”", "label": [[6500, 6569, "Logical Fallacy"], [10066, 10277, "Logical Fallacy"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/02/climate/atlantic-ocean-climate-change.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-ocean-circulation-system-is-slowing-down-as-accurately-described-in-the-new-york-times-article/"}
{"id": 432, "data": "Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created the conditions necessary for massive wildfires to consume portions of the West Coast , according to one fire expert who predicted the problem years ago .\nShortly before leaving office in 2001 , Clinton limited the ability of the United States Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the West into a pristine state , Bob Zybach , an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science , told the Daily Caller News Foundation . The former president ’ s decision created a ticking time bomb , Zybach argues .\n“ If you don ’ t start managing these forests , then they are going to start burning up . Thirty years later , they are still ignoring it , ” said Zybach , who spent more than 20 years as a reforestation contractor . He was referring to warnings he made years ago , telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in Oregon and California creates kindling fuelling fires .\nSuch rules make it more difficult to deploy prescribed burns , which are controlled burns designed to cull all of the underbrush in forests to lessen the chance of massive fires , Zybach noted . Years of keeping these areas in their natural state result in dead trees and dried organic material settling on the forest floor , turning such material into matchsticks soaked in jet fuel during dry seasons , he said .\nZybach ’ s comments come as wildfires continue churning through parts of California , Oregon , and Washington , media reports show . Fires have killed 26 people in West Coast states since August , including 19 people in California , and have culminated in more than half-a-million people evacuating Oregon , a number representing roughly 10 % of the state ’ s overall population .\nRoughly 100 massive fires are blazing Saturday in the West , including 12 in Idaho and nine in Montana , the National Interagency Fire Center said Saturday . All told , the wildfires have churned through more than 4.5 million acres in 12 states . ( RELATED : Wildfires , Blackouts And High Gas Prices : Californians Fight Familiar Foes Amid Pandemic )\nShortly before leaving office , Clinton introduced the Roadless Rule that restricted the use of existing roads and construction of new roads on 49 million acres of National Forest , making it difficult for officials to scan the land for the kind of kindling that fuels massive conflagrations .\nThe move was part of the Northwest Forest Plan ( NWFP ) , a resolution adopted by Clinton in 1994 to protect forests from being over-logged .\nTen years before Clinton ’ s rule , the Fish and Wildlife Service placed the northern spotted owl on the Endangered Species Act , forcing the Forest Service to adopt a new policy that resulted in a greater reduction in timber harvests . The amount of timber removed from federal lands plummeted , according to data accumulated in 2015 by the Reason Foundation .\nAn average of 10.3 billion feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990 , the data show . Those numbers dropped between 1991 and 2000 and continued dropping — an average of only 2.1 billion feet of timber was removed from the land between 2000 and 2013 , according to the data . That ’ s an 80 % decline .\n“ They ’ ve gone and left hundreds of thousands of acres of burnt timber , a fire bomb waiting to happen , standing in place because the black back woodpecker prefers that habitat , ” Zybach said . “ It ’ s great for lawyers , but it ’ s bad for people who breathe air or work in the woods . ”\n“ The prescribed burns are an ancient form of management for keeping the fuels down so these events don ’ t happen , ” Zybach added , referring to Native American Indians who used controlled burns to ward away pests and prevent wildfires from licking their homes .\nThe Clinton administration ’ s plan to turn forests in the West into pristine land free of human interference risked fueling “ wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn , the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire , ” Zybach , who is based in Oregon , told Evergreen magazine in 1994 , when the NWFP came into effect .\nWestern Oregon had one major fire above 10,000 acres between 1952 and 1987 , reports show . The Silver Complex Fire of 1987 snapped that streak after torching more than 100,000 acres in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area , killing rare plants and trees the federal government sought to protect from human activities .\nFire Experts Agree : Prescribed Burns Are Critical\nOverzealous fire suppression across California are helping to build up wildland fuels , which contribute to wildfires , according to Tim Ingalsbee , a fire ecologist who began a career in the 1980s as a wildland firefighter . The solution is “ to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load , ” he told ProPublica in August .\n“ It ’ s just … well … it ’ s horrible . Horrible to see this happening when the science is so clear and has been clear for years . I suffer from Cassandra syndrome , ” Ingalsbee said , referring to the Cassandra Syndrome , a Greek metaphor people use when they believe their valid warnings are not heeded .\n“ Every year I warn people : Disaster ’ s coming . We got to change . And no one listens . And then it happens . ”\nOther experts have made similar arguments in the past . ( RELATED : Decades Of Mismanagement Turned US Forests Into ‘ Slow-Motion Time Bombs ’ )\nOvergrown grasslands , forests , and woodlands contributed to California wildfires in 2017 , Sasha Berleman , a fire ecologist , told High Country News that year . “ I ’ m more certain than ever that there ’ s a lot we can do between now and the next time this happens to make it so that the negative consequences to people are nowhere near as dramatic , ” she said .\nThe devastating fires that ran through California ’ s wine country in October of 2017 killed 42 people and destroyed nearly 7,000 buildings , High Country News noted .\nThe solution might be easier said than done . Nearly 20 million acres in California , or an area about the size of Maine , will need to experience controlled burns to limit catastrophic wildfires , a January study from Nature Sustainability found .\nBlaming Climate Change\nFormer President Barack Obama suggested in a tweet Thursday that California ’ s wildfires are a result of climate change .\n“ The fires across the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities , ” Obama wrote in a tweet that included pictures showing how soot and ash from the wildfires are turning San Francisco ’ s sky bright orange .\nObama isn ’ t the only prominent Democrat tying the fires to global warming .\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , a Democrat from New York , published a tweet Saturday that read : “ The proof of the urgency of the climate crisis is literally in the air around us. ” Schumer included a link to a Sept. 10 article from CBS blaming climate change for the fires .\nZybach is not convinced . “ The lack of active land management is almost 100 percent the cause , ” he told the DCNF , noting that climate change has almost nothing to do with fire kindling gathering across the forest floors . Other researchers share his skepticism .\n“ Global warming may contribute slightly , but the key factors are mismanaged forests , years of fire suppression , increased population , people living where they should not , invasive flammable species , and the fact that California has always had fire , ” University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass told TheDCNF in 2018 .\nMass ’ s critique came as Mendocino Complex Fire was spreading across California on its way to becoming the largest wildfire in the state , engulfing more than 283,000 acres .\nEDITOR ’ S NOTE : A previous version of this article stated that an average of 10 million feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990 .

{"id": 433, "data": "Greenland 's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return , and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating . That 's according to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University .\n`` The ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state , where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago , we would still be pretty quickly losing mass , '' Ian Howat , co-author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University , said .\nGreenland 's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year , making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise , according to Michalea King , the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University .\nThe ice loss has been so massive in recent years , she said , that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland .\nIce melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year , and that 's likely to get worse . Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century , wiping away beaches and coastal properties .\nCoastal states like Florida , and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable . Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater . Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise .\n`` There 's a lot of places , like in Florida especially , where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas , '' King said . `` And that 's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that , that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline . ''\nThe study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts , leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels , making it difficult to prepare for the effects .\nThe study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland 's ice sheet . The authors found that after 2000 , the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water , even if climate change were reversed .\nEntire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change , Howat said , adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode .\nEven though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely can not be reversed , it 's just the first in a series of tipping points . If climate change continues at this rate , the rate of melting will get much worse .\n`` We 've passed the point of no return but there 's obviously more to come , '' Howat said . `` Rather than being a single tipping point in which we 've gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet , it 's more of a staircase where we 've fallen off the first step but there 's many more steps to go down into the pit .

{"id": 434, "data": "On behalf of environmentalists everywhere , I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years . Climate change is happening . It ’ s just not the end of the world . It ’ s not even our most serious environmental problem .\nI may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this . I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30 .\nBut as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony , and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report , I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public .\nHere are some facts few people know :\nHumans are not causing a “ sixth mass extinction ”\nThe Amazon is not “ the lungs of the world ”\nClimate change is not making natural disasters worse\nFires have declined 25 % around the world since 2003\nThe amount of land we use for meat — humankind ’ s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska\nThe build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests , not climate change , explain why there are more , and more dangerous , fires in Australia and California\nCarbon emissions have been declining in rich nations for decades and peaked in Britain , Germany and France in the mid-seventies\nAdapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor\nWe produce 25 % more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter\nHabitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change\nWood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels\nPreventing future pandemics requires more not less “ industrial ” agriculture\nI know that the above facts will sound like “ climate denialism ” to many people . But that just shows the power of climate alarmism .\nIn reality , the above facts come from the best-available scientific studies , including those conducted by or accepted by the IPCC , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and other leading scientific bodies .\nSome people will , when they read this imagine that I ’ m some right-wing anti-environmentalist . I ’ m not . At 17 , I lived in Nicaragua to show solidarity with the Sandinista socialist revolution . At 23 I raised money for Guatemalan women ’ s cooperatives . In my early 20s I lived in the semi-Amazon doing research with small farmers fighting land invasions . At 26 I helped expose poor conditions at Nike factories in Asia .\nI became an environmentalist at 16 when I threw a fundraiser for Rainforest Action Network . At 27 I helped save the last unprotected ancient redwoods in California . In my 30s I advocated renewables and successfully helped persuade the Obama administration to invest $ 90 billion into them . Over the last few years I helped save enough nuclear plants from being replaced by fossil fuels to prevent a sharp increase in emissions\nUntil last year , I mostly avoided speaking out against the climate scare . Partly that ’ s because I was embarrassed . After all , I am as guilty of alarmism as any other environmentalist . For years , I referred to climate change as an “ existential ” threat to human civilization , and called it a “ crisis . ”\nBut mostly I was scared . I remained quiet about the climate disinformation campaign because I was afraid of losing friends and funding . The few times I summoned the courage to defend climate science from those who misrepresent it I suffered harsh consequences . And so I mostly stood by and did next to nothing as my fellow environmentalists terrified the public .\nI even stood by as people in the White House and many in the news media tried to destroy the reputation and career of an outstanding scientist , good man , and friend of mine , Roger Pielke , Jr. , a lifelong progressive Democrat and environmentalist who testified in favor of carbon regulations . Why did they do that ? Because his research proves natural disasters aren ’ t getting worse .\nBut then , last year , things spiraled out of control .\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez said “ The world is going to end in twelve years if we don ’ t address climate change. ” Britain ’ s most high-profile environmental group claimed “ Climate Change Kills Children . ”\nThe world ’ s most influential green journalist , Bill McKibben , called climate change the “ greatest challenge humans have ever faced ” and said it would “ wipe out civilizations . ”\nMainstream journalists reported , repeatedly , that the Amazon was “ the lungs of the world , ” and that deforestation was like a nuclear bomb going off .\nAs a result , half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct . And in January , one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change .\nWhether or not you have children you must see how wrong this is . I admit I may be sensitive because I have a teenage daughter . After we talked about the science she was reassured . But her friends are deeply misinformed and thus , understandably , frightened .\nI thus decided I had to speak out . I knew that writing a few articles wouldn ’ t be enough . I needed a book to properly lay out all of the evidence .\nAnd so my formal apology for our fear-mongering comes in the form of my new book , Apocalypse Never : Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All .\nIt is based on two decades of research and three decades of environmental activism . At 400 pages , with 100 of them endnotes , Apocalypse Never covers climate change , deforestation , plastic waste , species extinction , industrialization , meat , nuclear energy , and renewables .\nSome highlights from the book :\nFactories and modern farming are the keys to human liberation and environmental progress\nThe most important thing for saving the environment is producing more food , particularly meat , on less land\nThe most important thing for reducing air pollution and carbon emissions is moving from wood to coal to petroleum to natural gas to uranium\n100 % renewables would require increasing the land used for energy from today ’ s 0.5 % to 50 %\nWe should want cities , farms , and power plants to have higher , not lower , power densities\nVegetarianism reduces one ’ s emissions by less than 4 %\nGreenpeace didn ’ t save the whales , switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did\n“ Free-range ” beef would require 20 times more land and produce 300 % more emissions\nGreenpeace dogmatism worsened forest fragmentation of the Amazon\nThe colonialist approach to gorilla conservation in the Congo produced a backlash that may have resulted in the killing of 250 elephants\nWhy were we all so misled ?\nIn the final three chapters of Apocalypse Never I expose the financial , political , and ideological motivations . Environmental groups have accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from fossil fuel interests . Groups motivated by anti-humanist beliefs forced the World Bank to stop trying to end poverty and instead make poverty “ sustainable. ” And status anxiety , depression , and hostility to modern civilization are behind much of the alarmism\nOnce you realize just how badly misinformed we have been , often by people with plainly unsavory or unhealthy motivations , it is hard not to feel duped .\nWill Apocalypse Never make any difference ? There are certainly reasons to doubt it .\nThe news media have been making apocalyptic pronouncements about climate change since the late 1980s , and do not seem disposed to stop .\nThe ideology behind environmental alarmsim — Malthusianism — has been repeatedly debunked for 200 years and yet is more powerful than ever .\nBut there are also reasons to believe that environmental alarmism will , if not come to an end , have diminishing cultural power .\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an actual crisis that puts the climate “ crisis ” into perspective . Even if you think we have overreacted , Covid-19 has killed nearly 500,000 people and shattered economies around the globe .\nScientific institutions including WHO and IPCC have undermined their credibility through the repeated politicization of science . Their future existence and relevance depends on new leadership and serious reform .\nFacts still matter , and social media is allowing for a wider range of new and independent voices to outcompete alarmist environmental journalists at legacy publications .\nNations are reorienting toward the national interest and away from Malthusianism and neoliberalism , which is good for nuclear and bad for renewables .\nThe evidence is overwhelming that our high-energy civilization is better for people and nature than the low-energy civilization that climate alarmists would return us to .\nAnd the invitations I received from IPCC and Congress late last year , after I published a series of criticisms of climate alarmism , are signs of a growing openness to new thinking about climate change and the environment .\nAnother sign is the response to my book from climate scientists , conservationists , and environmental scholars . `` Apocalypse Never is an extremely important book , ” writes Richard Rhodes , the Pulitzer-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb . “ This may be the most important book on the environment ever written , ” says one of the fathers of modern climate science Tom Wigley .\n“ We environmentalists condemn those with antithetical views of being ignorant of science and susceptible to confirmation bias , ” wrote the former head of The Nature Conservancy , Steve McCormick . “ But too often we are guilty of the same . Shellenberger offers ‘ tough love : ’ a challenge to entrenched orthodoxies and rigid , self-defeating mindsets . Apocalypse Never serves up occasionally stinging , but always well-crafted , evidence-based points of view that will help develop the ‘ mental muscle ’ we need to envision and design not only a hopeful , but an attainable , future . ”\nThat is all I that I had hoped for in writing it . If you ’ ve made it this far , I hope you ’ ll agree that it ’ s perhaps not as strange as it seems that a lifelong environmentalist , progressive , and climate activist felt the need to speak out against the alarmism .\nI further hope that you ’ ll accept my apology .", "label": [[404, 703, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1926, 2216, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [7848, 8194, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [137, 260, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4757, 4886, "Ad Populum"], [4383, 4412, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4906, 5002, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "http://archive.is/fH58q", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-by-michael-shellenberger-mixes-accurate-and-inaccurate-claims-in-support-of-a-misleading-and-overly-simplistic-argumentation-about-climate-change/"}

{"id": 439, "data": "From top to bottom , these stripes use Bureau of Meteorology data to show how temperatures have changed in Australia since 1910 . The colours indicate how much the average temperature of each year is above or below the average temperature from 1961 to 1990 .\n\nA blue line means that year was below average ; red means it was above average . As you can see there is a pretty clear trend happening — from cool to warm — over the past century . Over this time the world has warmed 0.81 degrees Celsius , and Australia has warmed even more , hitting 1.52 degrees above average last year ( 2019 ) .\n\nBut what about in your lifetime ?\n\nThis is what ’ s happened in your life . From 1970 to 2019 .\n\nLet ’ s show it in a slightly different way . The colours mean the same thing , but bars going left show a temperature below average , and bars going right show a temperature above average .\n\nIn the year you were born , Australia was 0.1 degrees below average , or put another way 1.62 degrees cooler than Australia ’ s hottest year on record , which is the one we ’ ve just experienced , when temperatures hit 1.52 degrees above average .\n\nBut what does this even mean ? Well let ’ s expand it out a bit . Think back to when you were six . By this point you ’ ve seen a few summers , probably run through a few sprinklers , burnt your feet on hot pavement — six-year-old you knows what hot feels like .\n\nWell , not compared to a six-year-old today , you don ’ t . They ’ ve lived through four of the five hottest years in Australia ; you were 44 years old before you experienced the warming they lived through in the first year of their life .\n\nNow we ’ re going to show you how this warming has already affected your life , or you can skip ahead and see what is in store for the future if we continue on burning fossil fuels as we always have .\n\nSmall increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days , and those hot days have a big impact .\n\nHigh temperatures are part and parcel of living in Australia , but there ’ s a point where humans struggle to survive .\n\nMany parts of the world , including parts of Australia , already experience this kind of heat . A study looking into deaths around the world from extreme heat found that in 2000 , 30.6 per cent of the world ’ s population were exposed to 20 or more days when temperatures reached this point , which they called the “ deadly threshold ” .\n\nAnd when temperatures head towards this threshold it starts to impact the ability of people to lead normal lives . Economic productivity decreases , and the sorts of activities that are a central part of Australian life — like playing sport or heading to the beach — are affected .\n\nAs the globe continues to warm , this sort of heat will spread , affecting more and more people for longer and longer periods of time .\n\nAnd even well below this threshold , extreme heat already has deadly consequences . The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires , which claimed the lives of 173 Australians , are etched into the national consciousness .\n\nBut in the heatwave that led up to the fires , the number of deaths soared . In Victoria 374 more people died in the week of January 26 , compared to the average for that time of year .\n\nThat ’ s not to underestimate the impact of bushfires — that innocuous sounding 1.52 degree rise has seen bushfire risk increase across the continent . When the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action approached the Federal Government in April they were drawing on decades of data showing that fire conditions are getting worse .\n\nSo it ’ s hotter , and there ’ s a greater risk of bushfires , but has Australia been getting drier ? I mean , there were droughts when you were a kid , right ? Well Australia hasn ’ t been getting drier overall , but where the rain is falling is changing and that is already having a big impact .\n\nIn the north of the country over summer , we ’ re actually getting more rain , but in the south where most Australians live — and where the majority of our food is produced — the country is drying out .\n\nAnd the way the rain falls is changing . Because the atmosphere can hold more water in warmer temperatures , when it does rain we ’ re getting more high-intensity , extreme rain events — the ones that are associated with flash flooding . Every degree of warming creates a 7 per cent increase in the intensity of those rain events .\n\nSo just in your lifetime you can already see a change in how the weather in Australia works . This is the reality of climate change — all the ingredients that are required for natural disasters start to collide with increasing regularity .\n\nWhat could that look like ? Well , those extreme events that used to be irregular occurrences become the normal experience of living in Australia .\n\nAnd for some Australians that ’ s already the case . Remember that six-year-old we compared you to before ? Their life has been dominated by drought , as temperature records continue to break .\n\nFor them , fire season starts at the beginning of spring and rainforests traditionally considered safe go up in flames , rewriting the rule book on how fires must be fought . They live in a world where conditions are so extreme that fire seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres overlap , stretching resources at a time when they ’ re needed most .\n\nIn the aftermath of these disasters , politicians often talk about how you can ’ t put one event down to climate change . But the catastrophic fires that are burning across the country have brought this link into sharp focus . December 2019 was the hottest on record , 3.21 degrees above average , and 2019 is Australia ’ s driest year on record .\n\nAs the temperature has increased , so has the ability of scientists to determine whether specific events are linked to climate change . They can now model how likely a specific event would be to occur under historical conditions , compared to the record temperatures we ’ re experiencing .\n\nBut it takes time to do these sums . While recently completed modelling shows that the extreme heat that played a role in Queensland ’ s 2018 fires was made more likely by climate change , we won ’ t know exactly how much impact it has had on the current fires until that modelling is done for them .\n\nBut in November , when he was asked to speak about the current fires Professor Ross Bradstock , the Director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong , didn ’ t mince words .\n\n“ We are now in uncharted territory , we ’ ve gone over the 1 million-hectare mark , and for the forests and woodlands in the eastern half of the state this is unprecedented , ” he said .\n\n“ It exceeds major fire seasons such as Christmas 2001 , January 1994 . We are approaching other significant fire seasons such as the alpine fires in 2003 in Victoria , and again in 2006 which were massive blazes .\n\n“ The most concerning thing to emphasise is it ’ s not over , we are not even into summer yet . ”\n\nProfessor Bradstock says these fires are a warning light that fits with the scenario predicted by climate modellers .\n\n“ We ’ re in a transition from talking over the horizon about climate models telling us about a hypothetical future , to actually experiencing changes that are consistent with some of those projections . ”\n\nThis all sounds pretty full-on , but what we ’ re experiencing this summer is just the beginning of how climate change will hurt us .\n\nTo see how , let ’ s look to the future ...\n\nWhat about a child born in Australia today — what will their life look like ?\n\nWe turned to Monash University to help explore modelling that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) uses to predict how climate change will impact the world in the future .\n\nThe IPCC says that in the next 10 years the world must begin to significantly reduce CO2 emissions . If we continue to use fossil fuels the way we currently do , modelling from the IPCC shows we will be on track for a 4-degree increase in temperatures this century .\n\nThat would mean that by the time a child born today is 20 , the 2018-19 summer we sweltered through would be considered a mild Australian summer .\n\nBy their 30th , the entire Barrier Reef will likely be facing bleaching events every year . This is far more frequent than the five to 10 years it needs to recover from one event .\n\nThe start of spring will no longer be a time of anticipation for a summer ahead . Instead it will herald the arrival of conditions like those that led to the latest fires .\n\nAnd when they turn 50 , they ’ ll probably be celebrating indoors . Remember those “ deadly threshold ” temperatures , beyond which humans struggle to survive ? They ’ re no longer isolated events . In this scenario , by 2100 , 73.9 per cent of the world ’ s population will be facing at least 20 days a year of deadly heat and humidity .\n\nAnd before you think that 20 days of this sort of heat is manageable , that ’ s just a minimum . For vast swathes of the globe , these temperatures will be the norm — and humans will have to learn how to live in an environment too hot for them .\n\nEven Sydney and Melbourne will be facing summers where temperatures top 50 degrees .\n\nBut what if the world actually makes the changes needed to considerably cut emissions ? The best case scenario IPCC modelling shows that if we cut emissions to limit warming to 1.5 degrees — as set out under the Paris Agreement — the future would be very different .\n\nIt would still be hotter and more dangerous than the present . Warming for the next 10 years is already locked in , but after that changes start to make a difference .\n\nWhen a child born today turns 20 , summer will likely be pretty similar to the summer of 2018 — hot and dangerous , but cooler than if we ’ d done nothing .\n\nIn this scenario they may still have the opportunity to visit a living Great Barrier Reef . Keeping the increase in global temperatures at or below 1.5 degrees means it ’ s more likely a portion of the reef will be able to survive the regular bleaching events , giving it a base to recover from and adapt to higher temperatures .\n\nAnd by the time they turn 50 , if globally we had managed to halt our emissions quickly back in the 2020s , the temperature will have begun to stabilise . We ’ ll still be facing extreme heat , but at a far more manageable level than if we ’ d done nothing to halt climate change .\n\nBy 2100 , 47.6 per cent of the world ’ s population will be facing more than 20 days per year of deadly temperatures — and far fewer people will be facing a world where those sorts of temperatures are the norm .\n\nTo achieve this scenario , things need to change quickly . Global emissions are still rising .\n\nWhile the Federal Government has committed to a reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 , the IPCC says current promises are nowhere near enough to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius .\n\nAt home , Australia emits less than 1.24 per cent of global emissions , but so do most countries . More than 170 countries emit less than Australia each year , and combined , this group of countries emits more than any of the largest emitters — 40 per cent of all emissions come from countries that each emit less than 2 per cent of global emissions . So , even if the major emitters decarbonise , it won ’ t be enough .\n\nDespite our high per-capita emissions , and our role as a major exporter of fossil fuels , high public support for action on climate change suggests this is possible .\n\nThe Australia Talks National Survey found that 79 per cent of us think Australia has a responsibility to take action on climate change , even if the biggest emitting countries don ’ t follow suit .\n\nAnd while the issue has divided our federal politicians for a decade , a majority of both Coalition and Labor voters want action .\n\nSo the will is there , but time is running out to find our way .\n\nThis is part of a series from the ABC News Story Lab on climate change .

{"id": 440, "data": "As soon as the words carbon footprint , emissions , pollution , and decarbonisation , climate emergency , extreme weather , unprecedented and extinction are used , I know I am being conned by ignorant activ­ists , populist scaremonger­ing , vote-chasing politicians and rent seekers .\n\nPollution by plastics , sulphur and nitrogen gases , particulates and chemicals occurs in developing countries . That ’ s real pollution . The major pollution in advanced economies is the polluting of minds about the role of carbon dioxide . There are no carbon emissions . If there were , we could not see because most carbon is black . Such terms are deliberately misleading , as are many claims .\n\nBut then again , we should be used to this after the hysteria about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching that has really been occurring for hundreds of years , fraudulent changing of past weather records , the ignoring of data that shows Pacific islands and the Maldives are growing rather than being inundated , and unsubstantiated claims polar ice is melting . By ignoring history and geology , any claim of unusual weather can be made sensational .\n\nWe ’ ve had reefs on planet Earth for 3500 million years . They came and went many times . The big killer of reefs was because sea level dropped and water temperature decreased . In the past , reefs thrived when water was warmer and there was an elevated carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere . Reef material is calcium carbonate , which contains 44 per cent carbon dioxide . Reefs need carbon dioxide ; it ’ s their basic food .\n\nWe are not living in a period of catastrophic climate change . The past tells us it ’ s business as usual .\n\nIt has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming .\n\nClimate models have been around 30 years . They have all failed . Balloon and satellite measurements show a disconnect from climate model predictions . If they have failed across the past 30 years when we can compare models with measurements , there is little chance that the climate projections across the next 50 years will be more successful . Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change . It does not . The role of the sun and clouds was not considered important by modellers . They are the major drivers for the climate on our planet .\n\nWe emit a trace atmospheric gas called carbon dioxide at a time in planetary history of low atmospheric carbon dioxide . The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas . Just because we are alive today does not mean we change major planetary systems that operated for billions of years . Earth ’ s climate dances to rhythms every day , every season and on far larger lunar , ocean , solar , orbital , galactic and tectonic cycles . Climate change is normal and continual . When cycles overlap , climate change can be rapid and large . Sporadic events such as supernovas and volcanic eruptions can also change climate .\n\nThe main greenhouse gas is water vapour . It is the only gas in air that can evaporate , humidify and condense into clouds that precipitate rain , hail and snow . These processes involve a transfer of energy , and water vapour makes the atmosphere behave like a giant airconditioner . Carbon dioxide is a non-condensable atmospheric gas like nitrogen and oxygen . Water vapour in air varies depending on temperature and location from five times the atmospheric carbon dioxide content in deserts to more than 100 times in the tropics . Water is 12 times more effective than carbon dioxide with respect to all incoming and outgoing radiation .\n\nEarth is unevenly heated . Our spinning oblate globe is influenced by two fluids of different composition and behaviour moving chaotically against each other over the irregular solid surface of the planet . Oceans hold most of the planet ’ s surface heat , not the atmosphere . Processes that occur during sunlight do not occur at night due to the prime driver of our planet ’ s surface temperature : the sun .\n\nCarbon dioxide is plant food . It is neither a pollutant nor a toxin . Without carbon dioxide , all life on Earth would die . Plants convert carbon dioxide , water and sunlight during photosynthesis into sugars , cellulose , fruit , vegetables and grains , which animal life uses as food . Marine organisms also take up and use carbon dioxide . Plants need almost three times today ’ s carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere to thrive . For decades horticulturalists have pumped carbon dioxide into glasshouses to increase yields . The fossil record shows that a thriving and diversification of plant and animal life occurs every time the atmosphere had a very high carbon dioxide content . In the past , warming has never been a threat to life on Earth . Why should it be now ? When there is a low atmospheric carbon dioxide content , especially during very cold times , life struggles .\n\nFor the past 500 million years , the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been decreasing and if we halved today ’ s atmospheric carbon dioxide content , all life would die . This carbon dioxide has been removed into the oceans and is sequestered into coral , shells , limey sediments and muds and on the land into coals , muds , soils and vegetation .\n\nAir contains 0.04 per cent carbon dioxide . We add carbon compounds to our bodies from food and drinks and exhale carbon dioxide . The human breath contains at least 4 per cent carbon dioxide . Our bodies contain carbon compounds . If we were so passionately concerned about our carbon footprint , then the best thing to do is to expire .\n\nIn our lifetime , there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature . On a larger scale , the ice caps show that after a natural orbitally driven warming , atmospheric carbon dioxide content increases 800 years later . Rather than atmos­pheric carbon dioxide driving temperature , it is the opposite . Geology shows us again there is no correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature . Each of the six major past ice ages began when the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present . The thought that a slight increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead to unstoppable global warming is demonstrably wrong .\n\nIn the past decade China has increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 53 per cent , 12 times Australia ’ s total carbon dioxide output of 1.3 per cent of the global total . The grasslands , forests , farms and continental shelves of Australia absorb far more carbon dioxide than we emit . The attack on emissions of the gas of life is an irrational attack on industry , our modern way of life , freedoms and prosperity . It has nothing to do with the environment .", "label": [[5047, 5125, "False Dilemma"], [6327, 6498, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [5539, 5643, "False Dilemma"], [5665, 5743, "False Causality"], [5766, 5975, "False Causality"], [5978, 6194, "False Causality"], [6617, 6746, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1046, 1132, "Intentional"], [2439, 2669, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3167, 3286, "Logical Fallacy"], [3539, 3643, "Ad Populum"], [4752, 4839, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1570, 1675, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1679, 1762, "Intentional"], [4059, 4182, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [4593, 4749, "False Causality"], [2183, 2314, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4840, 4947, "Equivocation"], [164, 282, "Ad Hominem"], [528, 621, "Logical Fallacy"], [1136, 1224, "Equivocation"], [2554, 2669, "False Dilemma"], [4059, 4127, "False Dilemma"], [4752, 4838, "Faulty Generalization"], [5539, 5643, "Logical Fallacy"], [6617, 6746, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"]], "source_url": "https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/lets-not-pollute-minds-with-carbon-fears/news-story/1a215e8b9d2d958f597654ea7b591bcc", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/ian-plimer-op-ed-in-the-australian-again-presents-long-list-of-false-claims-about-climate/"}
{"id": 444, "data": "Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap , reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier , longer lives . For decades , these models have projected dramatic warming from small , fossil-fueled increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide , with catastrophic consequences .\n\nYet , the real-world data aren ’ t cooperating . They show only slight warming , mostly at night and in winter . According to the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events , and the ongoing rise in sea level that began with the end of the ice age continues with no great increase in magnitude . The constancy of land-based records is obvious in data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n\nShould we trust these computer models of doom ? Let ’ s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be .\n\nAtmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings . NASA honored him for this achievement , and he was an author for a previous edition of the U.N. report . He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly .\n\nChristy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics . The result ? In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere , the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed . Overprediction also occurred at all other levels . Christy recently concluded that , on average , the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed .\n\nThis is a critical error . Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide . Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean , and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere . That ’ s important . Most of Earth ’ s agriculture is dependent upon the transfer of moisture from the tropics to temperate regions .\n\n\nChristy is not looking at surface temperatures , as measured by thermometers at weather stations . Instead , he is looking at temperatures measured from calibrated thermistors carried by weather balloons and data from satellites . Why didn ’ t he simply look down here , where we all live ? Because the records of the surface temperatures have been badly compromised .\n\nGlobally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900 : a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century , before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it , and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century .\n\nThe latest U.N. science compendium asserts that the latter half-degree is at least half manmade . But the thermometer records showed that the warming stopped from 2000 to 2014 . Until they didn ’ t . In two of the four global surface series , data were adjusted in two ways that wiped out the “ pause ” that had been observed .\n\nThe first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated , by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships ’ water intake . The size of the ship determines how deep the intake tube is , and steel ships warm up tremendously under sunny , hot conditions . The buoy temperatures , which are measured by precise electronic thermistors , were adjusted upwards to match the questionable ship data . Given that the buoy network became more extensive during the pause , that ’ s guaranteed to put some artificial warming in the data .\n\nThe second big adjustment was over the Arctic Ocean , where there aren ’ t any weather stations . In this revision , temperatures were estimated from nearby land stations . This runs afoul of basic physics .\n\nEven in warm summers , there ’ s plenty of ice over much of the Arctic Ocean . Now , for example , when the sea ice is nearing its annual minimum , it still extends part way down Greenland ’ s east coast . As long as the ice-water mix is well-stirred ( like a glass of ice water ) , the surface temperature stays at the freezing point until all the ice melts . So , extending land readings over the Arctic Ocean adds nonexistent warming to the record .\n\nFurther , both global and United States data have been frequently adjusted . There is nothing scientifically wrong with adjusting data to correct for changes in the way temperatures are observed and for changes in the thermometers . But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder , which increases the warming trend . That ’ s wildly improbable .\n\nIn addition , thermometers are housed in standardized instrument shelters , which are to be kept a specified shade of white . Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often , and darker stations absorb more of the sun ’ s energy . It ’ s no surprise that poor tropical countries show the largest warming from this effect .\n\nAll this is to say that the weather balloon and satellite temperatures used in Christy ’ s testimony are the best data we have , and they show that the U.N. ’ s climate models just aren ’ t ready for prime time .", "label": [[68, 162, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [207, 341, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [877, 900, "Ad Hominem"], [1664, 1734, "Intentional"], [2591, 2650, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4036, 4144, "Faulty Generalization"], [4838, 4967, "False Dilemma"], [4147, 4224, "Faulty Generalization"], [5432, 5516, "Faulty Generalization"], [458, 737, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1230, 1437, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [5097, 5300, "Intentional"], [4353, 4505, "Logical Fallacy"], [5097, 5300, "False Causality"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-great-failure-of-the-climate-models", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-examiner-op-ed-cherry-picks-data-to-mislead-readers-about-climate-models-patrick-michaels-caleb-stewart-rossiter/"}

{"id": 446, "data": "This week in Vancouver , Prime Minister Trudeau said the federal carbon tax , a key pillar in his government ’ s climate policy , will help protect Canadians from extreme weather . “ Extreme weather events are extraordinarily expensive for Canadians , our communities and our economy , ” he said , citing the recent tornadoes in Ottawa and wildfires in Western Canada . “ That ’ s why we need to act . ”\n\nWhile members of the media may nod along to such claims , the evidence paints a different story . Roger Pielke Jr. is a scientist at University of Colorado in Boulder who , up until a few years ago , did world-leading research on climate change and extreme weather . He found convincing evidence that climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather-related damages worldwide , once you correct for increasing population and wealth . He also helped convene major academic panels to survey the evidence and communicate the near-unanimous scientific consensus on this topic to policymakers . For his efforts , Pielke was subjected to a vicious , well-funded smear campaign backed by , among others , the Obama White House and leading Democratic congressmen , culminating in his decision in 2015 to quit the field .\n\nA year ago , Pielke told the story to an audience at the University of Minnesota . His presentation was recently circulated on Twitter . With so much misinformation nowadays about supposed climate emergencies , it ’ s worth reviewing carefully .\n\nPielke ’ s public presentation begins with a recounting of his rise and fall in the field . As a young researcher in tropical storms and climate-related damages , he reached the pinnacle of the academic community and helped organize the so-called Hohenkammer Consensus Statement , named after the German town where 32 of the leading scientists in the field gathered in 2006 to sort out the evidence . They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms , that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases , and that they didn ’ t expect that situation to change in the near future .\n\nAdvertisement\nArticle content\nShortly thereafter , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) released its 2007 report , largely agreeing with the Hohenkammer Consensus , while cherry-picking one unpublished study ( and highlighting it in the Summary for Policymakers ) that suggested a link between greenhouse gases and storm-related damages . But the author of that study — who just happened to be the same IPCC lead author who injected it into the report — later admitted his claim was incorrect , and when the study was finally published , denied the connection .\n\nIn 2012 , the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Weather came out and echoed the Hohenkammer Consensus , concluding that once you adjust for population growth and economic changes , there is no statistical connection between climate change and measures of weather-related damages . In 2013 Pielke testified to the United States Congress and relayed the IPCC findings . Shortly thereafter , Obama ’ s science advisor John Holdren accused him of misleading Congress and launched a lengthy but ill-informed attack on Pielke , which prompted congressional Democrats to open an investigation into Pielke ’ s sources of funding ( which quickly fizzled amid benign conclusions ) . Meanwhile heavily funded left-wing groups succeeded in getting him fired from a popular internet news platform . In 2015 Pielke quit the climate field .\n\nAdvertisement\nArticle content\nSo where did the science end up ?\n\nIn the second half of his talk , Pielke reviews the science as found in the most recent ( 2013 ) IPCC Assessment Report , the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment , and the most up-to-date scientific data and literature . Nothing substantial has changed .\n\nGlobally there ’ s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts , hurricanes and floods . Some regions experience more , some less and some no trend . Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another . There ’ s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity . If anything , the past 50 years has been relatively quiet . There ’ s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S . Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally . Since 1965 , more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase . And from 1940 to today , flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent .\n\nAdvertisement\nArticle content\nAnd on it goes . There ’ s no trend in U.S. tornado damage ( in fact , 2012 to 2017 was below average ) . There ’ s no trend in global droughts . Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but , unexpectedly , so are heatwaves .\n\nThe bottom line is there ’ s no solid connection between climate change and many major indicators of extreme weather that politicians keep talking about , such as hurricanes , tornadoes , droughts , rainfall and floods , despite Trudeau ’ s claims to the contrary . The continual claim of such links is misinformation employed for political and rhetorical purposes . Powerful people get away with it because so few people know what the numbers show . Many scientists who know better remain silent . And the few who push back against the propaganda , such as Roger Pielke Jr. , find themselves on the receiving end of abuse and career-threatening attacks , even though they have all the science in their corner .

{"id": 450, "data": "The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate .\n\nAmericans receive a daily barrage from the fake news media and climate “ experts ” reporting that each and every day , week , month or year is the hottest on record due to global warming . On Feb. 7 , several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record . Sadly , these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jive with reality over the past 140 years .\n\nThe same climate experts warn that record heat is just the tip of the iceberg . We are constantly told that global warming is the root cause behind any and all weather events that are extreme , destructive , unusual or uncomfortable . Many of these fear mongers also say we should stop burning fossil fuels that are causing this mayhem .\n\nIs the Earth truly experiencing the hottest weather on record ? Absolutely not .\n\nAfter examining actual weather records over the past 100 years , there is no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures .\n\nHowever , climate change alarmists always find somewhere on Earth where temperatures are hotter than ever . The focus is always on isolated temperatures that have reached all-time highs while ignoring reports of all-time record lows . These zealots would like you to believe that due to fossil fuel emissions , summers are now longer and hotter while winters are shorter and milder .\n\nYet , the actual temperature records tell a very different story . Did the Earth experience its hottest temperature ever this year ? The answer is no . The highest record temperature ever reported was 136 degrees Fahrenheit in Libya in 1922 . The record high temperature for the United States was 134 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley , California in 1913 . Fossil fuel emissions in 1913 and 1922 were negligible compared to today .\n\nThe coldest temperature ever reported was minus 129 degrees Fahrenheit in Vostok , Antarctica , in 1983 when Carbon dioxide emissions were five times higher than in 1913 . The coldest temperature in the lower 48 states ( excluding Alaska ) of minus 64 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded in 1996 in Embarrass , Minnesota . Did the media and climate scientists warn that this low temperature indicated that we are headed for another Ice Age ?\n\nThe maximum reported difference between high and low temperatures at a single location is 188 degrees Fahrenheit ( from minus 90F to plus 98F ) in Verhoyansk , Siberia . In fact , record changes of highs and lows have occurred in 22 U.S. cities on a single day . For example , in 1989 the temperature in Alamosa , Colorado , varied between a low of 35F and a high of 91F for a temperature swing of 56 degrees F .\n\nWe hope these examples , right out of the weather record books , compiled by C.C . Burt in his book Extreme Weather Changes , will help you to understand the scams alarmists are trying to pull . These examples all illustrate that cherry-picking record high temperatures in isolated locations tells absolutely nothing about the Earth ’ s climate .\n\nThe strongest heat wave ever recorded occurred in July 1936 , generating high temperatures in half of America ’ s 50 states . In 1935 , fossil fuel emissions were 25 times lower than today . America ’ s coldest year occurred in 1899 , when temperatures dropped below 0 F in all 50 states .\n\nClipboard\n\nInteresting that the figure above shows the most severe historic cold wave during the past century took place in 1936 , which was the same year when the strongest heat wave took place . In terms of general behavior , the global warming alarmist prediction is that as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase , the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease . However , these trends do not exist and the data dispels , rather than supports , the global warming hypothesis .\n\nConcurrently a compilation of all days since 1915 when temperatures exceeded 90F shows them decreasing with time rather than increasing in Figure 2 .\n\nClipboard03\n\nThe heat waves experienced in the 1930s and 1950s are clearly evident here . Once again , the data does not support the claim that the United States is hotter than ever as a result of rising Carbon dioxide levels .\n\nFrom 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement . However , since 1998 , little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase . This is totally consistent with variations in the amount of heat the Earth receives from the Sun .\n\nThese facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats which measure ocean temperatures at a variety of depths .

{"id": 451, "data": "INCHEON , South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations ’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “ no documented historic precedent . ”\n\nThe report , issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders , describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires , and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 — a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population .\n\nThe report “ is quite a shock , and quite concerning , ” said Bill Hare , an author of previous I.P.C.C . reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics , a nonprofit organization . “ We were not aware of this just a few years ago. ” The report was the first to be commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement , the 2015 pact by nations to fight global warming .\n\nThe authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate , the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.5 degrees Celsius ) above preindustrial levels by 2040 , inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty . Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number , 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) , because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change .\n\nThe new report , however , shows that many of those effects will come much sooner , at the 2.7-degree mark .\n\nAvoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years , said the authors , who estimate that the damage would come at a cost of $ 54 trillion . But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming , they concede that it may be politically unlikely .\n\n[ How much hotter is your hometown today than when you were born ? Find out here . ]\n\nFor instance , the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions — perhaps as high as $ 27,000 per ton by 2100 — would be required . But such a move would be almost politically impossible in the United States , the world ’ s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China . Lawmakers around the world , including in China , the European Union and California , have enacted carbon pricing programs .\n\nPresident Trump , who has mocked the science of human-caused climate change , has vowed to increase the burning of coal and said he intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement . And on Sunday in Brazil , the world ’ s seventh-largest emitter of greenhouse gas , voters appeared on track to elect a new president , Jair Bolsonaro , who has said he also plans to withdraw from the accord .\n\nThe report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies . The Paris agreement set out to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels — long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change . But the heads of small island nations , fearful of rising sea levels , had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming .\n\n[ What on Earth is going on ? Sign up to get our latest stories about climate change . ]\n\nAbsent aggressive action , many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040 , and at the lower temperature , the report shows . “ It ’ s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime , ” said Myles Allen , an Oxford University climate scientist and an author of the report .\n\nTo prevent 2.7 degrees of warming , the report said , greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 , and 100 percent by 2050 . It also found that , by 2050 , use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent . Renewable energy such as wind and solar , which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today , would have to increase to as much as 67 percent .\n\n“ This report makes it clear : There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal , ” said Drew Shindell , a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report .\n\nThe World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global warming calls for an end of coal use . In a statement , Katie Warrick , its interim chief executive , noted that forecasts from the International Energy Agency , a global analysis organization , “ continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future . ”\n\nMs. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology . Such technology , which is currently too expensive for commercial use , could allow coal to continue to be widely used .\n\nDespite the controversial policy implications , the United States delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting the report ’ s summary for policymakers , while walking a delicate diplomatic line . A State Department statement said that “ acceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report . ”\n\nThe State Department delegation faced a conundrum . Refusing to approve the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage . However , the delegation also represents a president who has rejected climate science and climate policy .\n\n“ We reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms that are better for the American people , ” the statement said .\n\nThe report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change . The estimated $ 54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would grow to $ 69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and beyond , the report found , although it does not specify the length of time represented by those costs .\n\nThe report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark . Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8 degrees since about the 1850s , the beginning of large-scale industrial coal burning , the report found .\n\nThe United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change . The report concluded that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming .\n\nThe report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions . “ A price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation , ” the report concludes . It estimates that to be effective , such a price would have to range from $ 135 to $ 5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030 , and from $ 690 to $ 27,000 per ton by 2100 .\n\nBy comparison , under the Obama administration , government economists estimated that an appropriate price on carbon would be in the range of $ 50 per ton . Under the Trump administration , that figure was lowered to about $ 7 per ton .\n\nAmericans for Prosperity , the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch , has made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon tax .\n\n“ Carbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas prices and electric rates , ” said Myron Ebell , who heads the energy program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , an industry-funded Washington research organization , and who led the Trump administration ’ s transition at the Environmental Protection Agency .\n\nThe report details the economic damage expected should governments fail to enact policies to reduce emissions . The United States , it said , could lose roughly 1.2 percent of gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warming .\n\nIn addition , it said , the United States along with Bangladesh , China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Japan , the Philippines and Vietnam are home to 50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased coastal flooding by 2040 , if 2.7 degrees of warming occur .\n\nAt 3.6 degrees of warming , the report predicts a “ disproportionately rapid evacuation ” of people from the tropics . “ In some parts of the world , national borders will become irrelevant , ” said Aromar Revi , director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report . “ You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people , but not 10 million . ”\n\nThe report also finds that , in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming , another scenario is possible : The world could overshoot that target , heat up by more than 3.6 degrees , and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology , bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold .\n\nIn that scenario , some damage would be irreversible , the report found . All coral reefs would die . However , the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off .\n\n“ For governments , the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they don ’ t have to make such rapid changes , ” Dr. Shindell said . “ But it has a lot of disadvantages . ”", "label": [[24, 348, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [693, 872, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4397, 4467, "False Dilemma"], [4748, 4890, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [5594, 5752, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [7699, 7784, "Intentional"], [8286, 8536, "Equivocation"], [8540, 8941, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-coverage-of-ipcc-report-clearly-presents-conclusions-coral-davenport/"}
{"id": 452, "data": "Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet , according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet .\n\nThe new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption , global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75 % – an area equivalent to the US , China , European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world . Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife .\n\nThe new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18 % of calories and 37 % of protein , it uses the vast majority – 83 % – of farmland and produces 60 % of agriculture ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . Other recent research shows 86 % of all land mammals are now livestock or humans . The scientists also found that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing .\n\nThe study , published in the journal Science , created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90 % of all that is eaten . It assessed the full impact of these foods , from farm to fork , on land use , climate change emissions , freshwater use and water pollution ( eutrophication ) and air pollution ( acidification ) .\n\n“ A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth , not just greenhouse gases , but global acidification , eutrophication , land use and water use , ” said Joseph Poore , at the University of Oxford , UK , who led the research . “ It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car , ” he said , as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions .\n\n“ Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems , ” he said . “ Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this . Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy . ”\n\nThe analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food . For example , beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture . But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark , with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land .\n\nThe large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm , Poore said , without needing the global population to become vegan . If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food , this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production .\n\nCutting the environmental impact of farming is not easy , Poore warned : “ There are over 570m farms all of which need slightly different ways to reduce their impact . It is an [ environmental ] challenge like no other sector of the economy. ” But he said at least $ 500bn is spent every year on agricultural subsidies , and probably much more : “ There is a lot of money there to do something really good with . ”\n\nLabels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start , so consumers could choose the least damaging options , he said , but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary .\n\nOne surprise from the work was the large impact of freshwater fish farming , which provides two-thirds of such fish in Asia and 96 % in Europe , and was thought to be relatively environmentally friendly . “ You get all these fish depositing excreta and unconsumed feed down to the bottom of the pond , where there is barely any oxygen , making it the perfect environment for methane production , ” a potent greenhouse gas , Poore said .\n\nThe research also found grass-fed beef , thought to be relatively low impact , was still responsible for much higher impacts than plant-based food . “ Converting grass into [ meat ] is like converting coal to energy . It comes with an immense cost in emissions , ” Poore said .\n\nThe new research has received strong praise from other food experts . Prof Gidon Eshel , at Bard College , US , said : “ I was awestruck . It is really important , sound , ambitious , revealing and beautifully done . ”\n\nHe said previous work on quantifying farming ’ s impacts , including his own , had taken a top-down approach using national level data , but the new work used a bottom-up approach , with farm-by-farm data . “ It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results . But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing . ”\n\nProf Tim Benton , at the University of Leeds , UK , said : “ This is an immensely useful study . It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust . The way we produce food , consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective . Given the global obesity crisis , changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier . ”\n\nDr Peter Alexander , at the University of Edinburgh , UK , was also impressed but noted : “ There may be environmental benefits , eg for biodiversity , from sustainably managed grazing and increasing animal product consumption may improve nutrition for some of the poorest globally . My personal opinion is we should interpret these results not as the need to become vegan overnight , but rather to moderate our [ meat ] consumption . ”\n\nPoore said : “ The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there . But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project . These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life . The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot . ”", "label": [[295, 349, "Intentional"], [0, 226, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-on-climate-impacts-of-diet-gets-mixed-reviews-from-scientists-damian-carrington/"}

{"id": 457, "data": "The sun won ’ t rise at the North Pole until March 20 , and it ’ s normally close to the coldest time of year , but an extraordinary and possibly historic thaw swelled over the tip of the planet this weekend . Analyses show that the temperature warmed to the melting point as an enormous storm pumped an intense pulse of heat through the Greenland Sea .\n\nTemperatures may have soared as high as 35 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) at the pole , according to the U.S . Global Forecast System model . While there are no direct measurements of temperature there , Zack Labe , a climate scientist working on his PhD at the University of California at Irvine , confirmed that several independent analyses showed “ it was very close to freezing , ” which is more than 50 degrees ( 30 degrees Celsius ) above normal .\n\nThe warm intrusion penetrated right through the heart of the Central Arctic , Labe said . The temperature averaged for the entire region north of 80 degrees latitude spiked to its highest level ever recorded in February . The average temperature was more than 36 degrees ( 20 degrees Celsius ) above normal . “ No other warm intrusions were very close to this , ” Labe said in an interview , describing a data set maintained by the Danish Meteorological Institute that dates back to 1958 . “ I was taken by surprise how expansive this warm intrusion was . ”\n\nSuch extreme warm intrusions in the Arctic , once rare , are becoming more routine , research has shown . A study published last July found that since 1980 , these events are becoming more frequent , longer-lasting and more intense .\n\n“ Previously this was not common , ” said lead author of the study Robert Graham , from the Norwegian Polar Institute , in an email . “ It happened in four years between 1980-2010 , but has now occurred in four out of the last five winters . ”\n\nArctic temperatures soar 45 degrees above normal , flooded by extremely mild air on all sides\n\nGraham explained that these warming events are related to the decline of winter sea ice in the Arctic , noting that January ’ s ice extent was the lowest on record . “ As the sea ice is melting and thinning , it is becoming more vulnerable to these winter storms , ” he explained . “ The thinner ice drifts more quickly and can break up into smaller pieces . The strong winds from the south can push the ice further north into the Central Arctic , exposing the open water and releasing heat to the atmosphere from the ocean . ”\n\nScientists were shocked in recent days to discover open water north of Greenland , an area normally covered by old , very thick ice . “ This has me more worried than the warm temps in the Arctic right now , ” tweeted Mike MacFerrin , an ice sheet specialist at the University of Colorado .\n\nSuch warm water is appearing to have an effect on air temperatures . At the north tip of Greenland , about 400 miles to the south of the North Pole , the weather station Cape Morris Jesup has logged a record-crushing 61 hours above freezing so far this calendar year . The previous record , dating to 1980 , was 16 hours through the end of April in 2011 , according to Robert Rohde , a physicist at Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit that conducts temperature analysis . At one point , the temperature was as high as 43 degrees ( 6.1 degrees Celsius ) .\n\nKent Moore , a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Toronto , who published a study in 2016 linking the loss of sea ice to these warm events in the Arctic , said a number of factors may have contributed to the latest warming episode .\n\nFor one , he said , recent storms have tracked more toward the North Pole through the Greenland Sea , drawing heat directly north from lower latitudes , rather than through a more circuitous route over the Barents Sea . He also said ocean temperatures in the Greenland Sea are warmer than normal . “ The warmth we ’ re seeing in the Greenland Sea is definitely enhancing the warm events we ’ re seeing , ” Moore said . “ I ’ m surprised how warm it is , but I am not sure why . ”\n\nThe rise in Arctic temperatures is probably also tied to a sudden warming of the stratosphere , the atmospheric layer about 30,000 feet high — above where most weather happens — that occurred several weeks ago , Moore said . Why these stratospheric warming events happen is poorly understood , as are their consequences . However , they tend to rearrange warm and cold air masses , and this latest one has also been linked not only to the Arctic warmth but also to the “ Beast from the East ” cold spell over Europe .\n\nMoore stopped short of saying that the warm spikes observed in the Arctic in recent years are a sure sign that they are becoming a fixture of the winter Arctic climate ; more data is needed , he cautioned .\n\nWhether a blip or indicative of a new normal , scientists have uniformly expressed disbelief at the current Arctic temperatures and the state of the sea ice .\n\n“ This is a crazy winter , ” said Alek Petty , a climate scientist at NASA , in an interview . “ I don ’ t think we ’ re sensationalizing it . ”\n\n“ It ’ s never been this extreme , ” Ruth Mottram , a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute , told Reuters .", "label": [[1750, 1855, "Ad Populum"], [3876, 3977, "False Causality"], [4784, 4940, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/02/26/north-pole-surges-above-freezing-in-the-dead-of-winter-stunning-scientists/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-article-accurately-discusses-warm-arctic-weather-event-jason-samenow/"}

{"id": 462, "data": "The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world ’ s governments , according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “ just as urgent ” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels .\n\nRazing the world ’ s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide , more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil , coal and gas . By protecting and restoring forests , the world would achieve 18 % of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change , the group of 40 scientists , spanning five countries , said in a statement .\n\n“ We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world ’ s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves , ” the statement reads .\n\nThe intervention comes as the UN ’ s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday ’ s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C ( 2.7F ) beyond pre-industrial levels , an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015 .\n\nIt is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system , rather than forests . “ In responding to the IPCC report , our message as scientists is simple : Our planet ’ s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests , ” the scientists ’ statement pointedly concludes .\n\nTrees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO2 humans are adding to the atmosphere , softening the potential impact of climate change .\n\nWhile the world won ’ t lose all of its trees , large tracts of tropical forests , which hold a vast amount of carbon , are still being lost in the Amazon , central Africa and Indonesia . Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes , as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame .\n\n“ The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I don ’ t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough , ” said Deborah Lawrence , a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement . “ We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year , which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink .\n\n“ Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon , but that hasn ’ t happened elsewhere . As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests , which really worries me . ”\n\nThe IPCC ’ s report is expected to mention the need for as-yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target .\n\nThe statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy , known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage ( Beccs ) , is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy .\n\n“ It breaks my heart to think we ’ d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves , ” Lawrence said . “ It ’ s horrifying that we ’ d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change . Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara . ”\n\nLawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “ negative emissions ” technology that would damage forests ’ ability to suck up carbon , maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds , mammals , insects and other creatures .\n\n“ We will have a hotter , drier world without these forests , ” Lawrence said . “ There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests . And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate . ”\n\nThe prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim , however , with a co-author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “ nowhere near on track ” to meet its Paris commitments .", "label": [[2450, 2553, "False Dilemma"], [3031, 3141, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3158, 3235, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3238, 3331, "False Dilemma"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/04/climate-change-deforestation-global-warming-report", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-conveys-statement-scientists-stressing-role-of-deforestation-climate-change-oliver-milman/"}
{"id": 463, "data": "Even before Hurricane Florence made landfall somewhere near the border of North and South Carolina , predicted damage from potentially catastrophic flooding from the storm was already being blamed on global warming .\n\nWriting for NBC News , Kristina Dahl contended , “ With each new storm , we are forced to question whether this is our new , climate change-fueled reality , and to ask ourselves what we can do to minimize the toll from supercharged storms . ”\n\nThe theory is that tropical cyclones have slowed down in their speed by about 10 percent over the past 70 years due to a retreat of the jet stream farther north , depriving storms of steering currents and making them stall and keep raining in one location . This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year .\n\nBut like most claims regarding global warming , the real effect is small , probably temporary , and most likely due to natural weather patterns . Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years , even if real , can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data . Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today . Why ? No one knows .\n\nUnusual things happen in nature sometimes\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm , with up to a 20-foot storm surge . While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore , it happened again there in 1675 , with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm .\n\nUntil 2017 , the United States went 11 years without a major hurricane strike — something that is statistically very improbable . Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought , a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event .\n\nMy point is that nature varies , and unusual things happen sometimes .\n\nNow it ’ s fashionable to blame stalling hurricanes on global warming . In the case of Florence , the jet stream is indeed pushed farther north . But examination of a weather map of the atmospheric flow at an altitude of 18,000 feet shows the jet stream is pushed farther south over western North America . This kind of natural variation in atmospheric flow is called weather , not climate change . It ’ s just a roll of the dice . Hurricane-steering currents are subject to whatever the weather happens to be when they arrive at the U.S. coast .\n\nNo one should dismiss or minimize the damage that Florence will likely do . Hurricanes can be deadly . I completely agree with Ms. Dahl 's NBC News piece that “ right now , our number one priority has to be ensuring the safety of those in Florence ’ s evolving path , as well as the first responders helping them . ”\n\nThe cost of storms has risen , not their severity\nBut a major hurricane hits North Carolina on average once every 20 years or so . The last was Fran in 1996 , which is 22 years ago . Coastal residents know they live under a yearly threat of hurricanes , and sometimes ( though relatively rarely ) , one of those hurricanes will be very strong .\n\nWell , aren ’ t we being told these storms are getting stronger on average ? The answer is no . The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history ( according to federal data from January ) show no increase in intensity over time . The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades , but that is due to increasing population , wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure . It ’ s not due to stronger storms .\n\nIf humans have any influence on hurricanes at all , it probably won ’ t be evident for many decades to come . Natural variability is simply too large . This should not be surprising given that humanity ’ s greenhouse gas emissions have caused only a1 percent change in the natural energy flows coursing through the climate system .\n\nRoy W.

{"id": 464, "data": "The oldest and thickest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break up , opening waters north of Greenland that are normally frozen , even in summer .\n\nThis phenomenon – which has never been recorded before – has occurred twice this year due to warm winds and a climate-change driven heatwave in the northern hemisphere .\n\nOne meteorologist described the loss of ice as “ scary ” . Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest .\n\nThe sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to , until recently , as “ the last ice area ” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet .\n\nBut abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds , which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s .\n\n“ Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile , ” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute . “ Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual . This area has often been called ‘ the last ice area ’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here . The events of the last week suggest that , actually , the last ice area may be further west . ”\n\nIce to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream , one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline , where it packs .\n\nWalt Meier , a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center , said : “ The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up . On average , it ’ s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more . This thick , compacted ice is generally not easily moved around .\n\n“ However , that was not the case this past winter ( in February and March ) and now . The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds . ”\n\nIce is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend , which has accelerated over the past 15 years . “ The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice . So it ’ s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate . ”\n\n“ Scary , ” wrote Thomas Lavergne , a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute , in a retweet of a satellite-gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline .\n\nHe said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters .\n\n“ I can not tell how long this open water patch will remain open , but even if it closes in few days from now , the harm will be done : the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast , to an area where it will melt more easily , ” he added .\n\nThis year ’ s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes . In February , the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C , but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds , which unlocked the ice from the coast .\n\nLast week , the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots . Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal .\n\n“ I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze-up and ice formation , ” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe , a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute .\n\nThe latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40 % below the average for this time of year since 1981 . In the past month , at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region . Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall , they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050 .\n\nKeld Qvistgaard , the ice service coordinator in Denmark , said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent . “ This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup . This is unusual , ” he said .\n\nAs well as reducing ice cover , the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks , which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state .\n\nFreakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year . During the sunless winter , a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding .\n\nThis includes the Gulf Stream , which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming . With lower circulation of water and air , weather systems tend to linger longer .\n\nA dormant hot front has been blamed for record temperatures in Lapland and forest fires in Siberia , much of Scandinavia and elsewhere in the Arctic circle .", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/arctics-strongest-sea-ice-breaks-up-for-first-time-on-record", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-accurately-covers-sea-ice-event-but-makes-unsupported-connection-weather-patterns-gulf-stream-jonathan-watts/"}
{"id": 468, "data": "There 's a cycle that starts when the snow melts and the earth thaws high in Colorado 's Rocky Mountains . It 's a seasonal cycle based on timing and temperature , two variables that climate change is pushing increasingly out of sync .\n\nTo the outsider , it can be hard to see : Plants still grow , flowers bud , bears awake , and marmots breed . Broad-tailed hummingbirds still trill around a landscape that evokes the opening scene of The Sound of Music , with flowery meadows and granite peaks .\n\nBut those who know this ecosystem will tell you something is a little off . The flowers are blooming earlier . The marmots are mating in early May . Spring is springing sooner across the Northern Hemisphere , changing natural cycles around the world .\n\nIn Alaska , brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier .\n\nIn California , birds are nesting and breeding a week earlier than they did a century ago .\n\n`` One of the consequences of climate change is that even though everything is happening earlier , they 're not changing at the same rate , '' says David Inouye , an ecologist from the University of Maryland who has spent more than 40 years documenting the change in Colorado 's alpine meadows .\n\nThe results can be seen all around him . Flowers are blooming before there are bees to pollinate them . Hard frosts are still occurring long after winter 's snow melts away , decimating fruit orchards and budding plants . Allergy season is getting longer .\n\nInouye says that when he started spending his summers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic , Colo. , cataloging flowers in the thin mountain air , climate change was n't really a thing people were talking about . But as time went on , the evidence of it started to become unavoidable .\n\n`` Temperatures are getting warmer here , '' he says . `` The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be . ''\n\nSome plants and wildlife , taking their thermal cue , have been able to adapt in kind . Some are thriving . Others are being left behind .\n\nFewer flowers , fewer worker bees\n\nColorado 's snowpack this year was the worst it had been in more than 30 years . Temperatures in early spring soared .\n\nMany researchers here view this as a glimpse of things to come .\n\n`` You can see it visually , '' says Rebecca Irwin , an ecologist from North Carolina State University . `` We have less flowers . ''\n\nFewer flowers means less food for the native bees that buzz around in meadows like the one Irwin stands in .\n\nShe and two others are equipped with wispy butterfly nets and fanny packs filled with plastic vials .\n\nThey 're hoping to get an idea of how different bees are doing in this environment by catching as many of them as they can over the course of an hour . It is a task that proves easy .\n\nWith lunges and hops , they catch sweat bees and leafcutter bees , queens and workers .\n\nAt the end of the time period , it 's clear that they caught far fewer worker bees than they would have in a normal year .\n\n`` It 's hard to know if they 're just delayed or if they 're not doing well because there 's no food for them , '' Irwin says .\n\nSome bees , Irwin says , seem to be doing fine . In years like this , they 're able to emerge earlier to meet the early bloom .\n\n`` But some of them are constrained by how long it takes them to develop , '' she says .\n\nThe fear is that those bees and the flowers that depend on them for pollination could slowly get pushed out .\n\nMichael Stemkovski of North Carolina State says documenting these changes can be disheartening . `` It 's kind of like watching an illness progress without having the tools to remedy it . ''\n\nWe may not like the climate change winners\n\nThe ability of a species to adapt to its circumstances — to roll with the environmental punches , so to speak — is called plasticity .\n\nSpecies that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists . They 're able to make the situation work . Species with less plasticity , those that depend on a specific ecosystem or climate , are more likely to struggle .\n\n`` When you think of a plant that ca n't move over its lifetime , it either tolerates a dry area or it does n't , '' says Dan Blumstein , a conservation biologist from the University of California , Los Angeles . He specializes in marmots , a large ground squirrel that is , in Blumstein 's words , `` remarkably plastic . ''\n\n`` Marmots are all about getting obese , '' Blumstein says . `` They adjust their annual schedule appropriately to be active when the vegetation is growing . ''\n\nAn earlier spring means a longer growing season , so they have more time to gather food . As a result , Blumstein says , marmots seem to be getting bigger . He stops short of calling them a `` climate change winner '' though , noting that a longer growing season also means more chances for them to be killed by predators .\n\nOther species are emerging as winners though , including `` some that people might not be very fond of , '' says Jill Anderson , a geneticist at the University of Georgia .\n\nShe points to poison ivy , which is expected to thrive with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .\n\nResearchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory also report seeing far more ticks this summer than in any previous year . That report is consistent with studies showing that the range for ticks is increasing with a warming climate .\n\nAnd there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity , which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well .\n\nA glimpse of the future\n\nJust off a ridge , in a verdant meadow , John Harte , an ecologist from the University of California , Berkeley , has created a window into the future of this place . It 's a grim one .\n\n`` When I tell people what to expect , I say , 'Well , imagine the opening scene of The Sound of Music was filmed outside of Reno , Nevada , ' `` he says . `` Because that 's what it 's going to be . ''\n\nTwenty eight years ago , Harte suspended a series of heat lamps in long , humming rows , a few feet off the ground . The lamps , which were designed for chicken farmers in Pennsylvania , raise the temperature on the ground by about 4 to 5 degrees .\n\n`` That 's comparable to the climate we expect by the year 2050 , '' he says .\n\nThe heat lamps have been on since then , day and night , and the change that is occurring beneath them is remarkable .\n\nThe yellow and purple flowers that dot the landscape nearby are mostly gone . In their place is sagebrush , a prolific plant that you would usually see at lower elevations .\n\n`` We are projecting that all of these meadows are going to look like that , '' Harte says , pointing to the gnarled plant . `` We are homogenizing the planet . ''\n\nThere 's another concern , just as great . Harte and his colleagues have found that the heated soil holds far less carbon than the native ground . That missing carbon , he says , is going into the air , creating the potential for a feedback process that will accelerate climate change further .\n\n`` Ecosystems affect climate just as much as climate affects ecosystems , '' he says . `` And the changes happen quick .

In terms of rate of change , we are in uncharted waters , ” said study co-author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia .\n\nThis could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe .\n\n“ Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound , ” said study co-author Alan Mix , a scientist from Oregon State University .\n\n“ We can expect that sea-level rise could become unstoppable for millennia , impacting much of the world ’ s population , infrastructure and economic activity , ” Mix said .\n\nIn looking at Earth 's past , scientists can predict what the future will look like .

But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change .

{"id": 474, "data": "Mario Rosales , who farms 365 acres along the Rio Grande , knows the river is in bad shape this year . It has already dried to a dusty ribbon of sand in some parts , and most of the water that does flow is diverted to irrigate crops , including Mr. Rosales ’ s fields of wheat , oats , alfalfa and New Mexico ’ s beloved chiles .\n\nBecause last winter ’ s mountain snowpack was the second-lowest on record , even that irrigation water may run out at the end of July , three months earlier than usual . But Mr. Rosales isn ’ t worried . He is sure that the summer thunderstorms , known here as the monsoon , will come .\n\n“ Sooner or later , we ’ ll get the water , ” he said .\n\nThe monsoon rains he is counting on are notoriously unpredictable , however . So he and many of the other farmers who work 62,000 acres along 140 miles of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico may get by — or they may not .\n\n“ Nobody ’ s got a whole lot of water , ” said David Gensler , the hydrologist for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District , whose job is to manage the river water that is delivered to Mr. Rosales and the others through diversion dams , canals and ditches . “ If we use it up early in the season and don ’ t get any rain further on , the whole thing ’ s going to crash . ”\n\nParts of the state got some much-needed rain this week , which may help Mr. Gensler extend his irrigation water a bit . But whatever happens this spring and summer , the long-term outlook for the river is clouded by climate change .\n\nThis image , taken on May 17 , shows a stretch of the river that is expected to dry earlier than usual because of reduced water flow and diversion for irrigation .\n\nAs the river dries , crews rescue endangered minnows from remaining pools of water .\n\nThe Rio Grande is a classic “ feast or famine ” river , with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery . If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier , as scientists anticipate , year-to-year recovery will become more difficult .\n\n“ The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times , ” said David S. Gutzler , a climate scientist at the University of New Mexico . “ And it makes the dry times much harder than they used to be . ”\n\nWith spring runoff about one-sixth of average and more than 90 percent of New Mexico in severe to exceptional drought , conditions here are extreme . Even in wetter years long stretches of the riverbed eventually dry as water is diverted to farmers , but this year the drying began a couple of months earlier than usual . Some people are concerned that it may dry as far as Albuquerque , 75 miles north .\n\nBut the state of the Rio Grande reflects a broader trend in the West , where warming temperatures are reducing snowpack and river flows .\n\nA study last year of the Colorado River , which provides water to 40 million people and is far bigger than the Rio Grande , found that flows from 2000 to 2014 were nearly 20 percent below the 20th century average , with about a third of the reduction attributable to human-caused warming . The study suggested that if climate change continued unabated , human-induced warming could eventually reduce Colorado flows by at least an additional one-third this century .\n\n“ Both of these rivers are poster children for what climate change is doing to the Southwest , ” said Jonathan T. Overpeck , dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan and an author of the Colorado study .\n\nWhile both the Colorado and the Rio Grande are affected by warming , Dr. Overpeck said , the Rio Grande has also been hurt by declines in winter precipitation . “ It ’ s a one-two punch , ” he said .\n\nLast year , though , was a wet one on the Rio Grande , with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016-17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs . Using that water now should help Mr. Gensler keep the irrigation taps turned for several months .\n\n“ In some ways I ’ m more concerned about 2019 than 2018 , ” he said . “ There ’ s a possibility we ’ re going to drain every drop this year , and go into next year with nothing . ”\n\nTemperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit ( one degree Celsius ) from 1901 to 2010 , and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century . As elsewhere in the West , warmer temperatures in winter mean that more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains that feed the Rio Grande .\n\nDr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact , too , with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear . A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect , Dr. Overpeck said , as plants take up more water , further reducing stream flows .\n\nRunning for nearly 1,900 miles , mostly through arid lands , the Rio Grande is one of the longest rivers in the United States . It is also one of the most managed , having been controlled by dams and other structures for most of the last century . But use of the river for irrigation dates back much further : For hundreds of years its water nourished the crops of native Puebloan people and Spanish colonizers .\n\nIn a typical year most water in the upper Rio Grande is diverted for irrigation . ( Albuquerque , by far the state ’ s largest city , gets its drinking water from groundwater wells and from a project that diverts water from the Colorado River basin through a tunnel under the Continental Divide . )\n\nBy law , some Rio Grande water must also be sent further downstream , to a reservoir that serves farmers in southern New Mexico and Texas . That section of the river , which forms the border with Mexico and empties into the Gulf of Mexico , has its own severe problems , and relies on a Mexican tributary for most of its water .\n\nAs the river dries , crews from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service spring into action , working to rescue the Rio Grande silvery minnow , a federally protected endangered species that used to thrive along the full length of the river but now is found only in the upper reaches .\n\nCrews have been rescuing the small fish most springs and summers for about 20 years , running nets through pools that remain as the river dries up and delivering the fish to wetter areas upstream .\n\nNormally the crews would start this work in June , said Thomas P. Archdeacon , a Fish and Wildlife biologist who heads the minnow rescue operation . This year , he said , they made their first rescue on April 2 and have moved northward as stretches of the river dried up .\n\n“ I look at it as an umbrella species , ” he said of the minnow . “ Because it has these federal protections , it ’ s protecting basically everything along the river. ” The Rio Grande is still lined with willows , Russian olive and other vegetation along its banks , and together with the irrigated farmland forms a long , narrow oasis amid an otherwise parched brown landscape .\n\nBut much of the riverbed itself is as dry as a bone .\n\nMr. Archdeacon had driven an all-terrain vehicle up the sandy riverbed from the town of San Antonio , reaching a spot about three miles north where the flowing river petered out into damp sand . This was what remained of the water allowed through a dam in San Acacia , about 20 miles to the north , the rest being diverted for irrigation .\n\nMr. Rosales will be benefiting from that diverted water , and if the monsoon rains come he may well produce a plentiful crop of chiles in late summer and fall for his wife , Linda , to roast and sell at a nearby produce stand .\n\n“ We ’ ve got a lot of faith , ” he said . “ We ’ ve always worked on faith . ”\n\nOthers may not have to hope for rain . Chris Sichler , who farms 650 acres near San Antonio , has wells to pump groundwater onto his fields should the irrigation canals dry up and the rains not materialize . “ I ’ m droughtproof , ” he said . “ When we plant in the spring we don ’ t even take into consideration how much snowpack or surface water there ’ s going to be . ”\n\nNorth of Albuquerque , Derrick J. Lente , a member of the Sandia Pueblo , cultivates 150 acres , some of which is pasturage for cows that he raises . Under water laws , farmers in the pueblos would be among the last to lose water .\n\nHis ancestors have farmed in this region for hundreds of years , through wet times and dry . But Mr. Lente , who is also a state legislator , recognizes that there is long-term trouble ahead . His father and uncles , who have been farming far longer than him , have seen changes .\n\n“ This is the worst they ’ ve seen it in their lives , ” he said . “ The times are changing to where it ’ s hotter . ”\n\nMr. Lente does not have irrigation wells on his farm , but he has made improvements to conserve water , lining some of his irrigation ditches and replacing another with a tunnel .\n\n“ I never built it with the idea we won ’ t ever have water , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to think of that time , I really don ’ t . We ’ d have to make some hard decisions . ”", "label": [[6002, 6287, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/24/climate/dry-rio-grande.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-story-accurately-describes-rio-grandes-climate-context-henry-fountain/"}
{"id": 475, "data": "Of all known and imagined consequences of climate change , many people fear sea-level rise most . But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology . The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “ enigma ” ; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle .\n\nIt is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water , the so-called steric component . But by studying a very short time interval , it is possible to sidestep most of the complications , like “ isostatic adjustment ” of the shoreline ( as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted ) and “ subsidence ” of the shoreline ( as ground water and minerals are extracted ) .\n\nI chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45 , when a genuine , independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred . I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming ; it continues at the same rate , 1.8 millimeters a year , according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr . I therefore conclude—contrary to the general wisdom—that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise . That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide .\n\nThis conclusion is worth highlighting : It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels . The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise .\n\nBut there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at a constant rate . The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges , many of which have been collecting data for over a century .\n\nThe cause of the trend is a puzzle . Physics demands that water expand as its temperature increases . But to keep the rate of rise constant , as observed , expansion of sea water evidently must be offset by something else . What could that be ? I conclude that it must be ice accumulation , through evaporation of ocean water , and subsequent precipitation turning into ice . Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries .\n\nIt is difficult to explain why evaporation of seawater produces approximately 100 % cancellation of expansion . My method of analysis considers two related physical phenomena : thermal expansion of water and evaporation of water molecules . But if evaporation offsets thermal expansion , the net effect is of course close to zero . What then is the real cause of sea-level rise of 1 to 2 millimeters a year ?\n\nMelting of glaciers and ice sheets adds water to the ocean and causes sea levels to rise . ( Recall though that the melting of floating sea ice adds no water to the oceans , and hence does not affect the sea level . ) After the rapid melting away of northern ice sheets , the slow melting of Antarctic ice at the periphery of the continent may be the main cause of current sea-level rise .\n\nAll this , because it is much warmer now than 12,000 years ago , at the end of the most recent glaciation . Yet there is little heat available in the Antarctic to support melting .\n\nWe can see melting happening right now at the Ross Ice Shelf of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet . Geologists have tracked Ross ’ s slow disappearance , and glaciologist Robert Bindschadler predicts the ice shelf will melt completely within about 7,000 years , gradually raising the sea level as it goes .\n\nOf course , a lot can happen in 7,000 years . The onset of a new glaciation could cause the sea level to stop rising . It could even fall 400 feet , to the level at the last glaciation maximum 18,000 years ago .\n\nCurrently , sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature , and certainly not on CO2 . We can expect the sea to continue rising at about the present rate for the foreseeable future . By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so—a far cry from Al Gore ’ s alarming numbers . There is nothing we can do about rising sea levels in the meantime . We ’ d better build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher .", "label": [[210, 338, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1106, 1231, "Logical Fallacy"], [3572, 3736, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3751, 3837, "False Dilemma"], [1967, 2236, "False Causality"], [3538, 3642, "Logical Fallacy"], [4032, 4160, "Logical Fallacy"], [473, 570, "Intentional"], [764, 983, "Intentional"], [986, 1230, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3153, 3219, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3936, 4029, "Ad Populum"]], "source_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sea-is-rising-but-not-because-of-climate-change-1526423254", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-commentary-grossly-misleads-readers-about-science-of-sea-level-rise-fred-singer/"}
{"id": 476, "data": "The average concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth 's atmosphere topped 411 parts per million in May .\nIn April — the previous month — the concentration hit 410 ppm for the first time in recorded history .\nThese are the highest CO2 levels in the 800,000 years for which we have good data .\nThis is expected to have a catastrophic effect on human health and the planet .\nWe have a pretty good idea of what Earth 's atmosphere has looked like for the past 800,000 years .\nHumans like us — Homo sapiens — evolved about 200,000 years ago , but ice-core records reveal intricate details of our planet 's history from long before humans existed . By drilling more than 3 kilometers deep into the ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica , scientists can see how temperature and atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels have changed .\n\nFrom that record , we know the atmosphere and the air that we breathe has never had as much carbon dioxide in it as it does today .\n\nFor the first time in recorded history , the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million in April , according to observations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii . In May , that number climbed above 411 ppm , according to researchers from Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n\nThe record is not a coincidence — humans have rapidly transformed the air we breathe by pumping CO2 into it over the past two centuries . In recent years , we 've pushed those gas levels into uncharted territory .\n\nThat change has inevitable and scary consequences . Research indicates that if unchecked , increased CO2 levels could cause pollution-related deaths to increase by tens of thousands , and lead to the slowing of human cognition ( especially when you take into account the fact that CO2 levels tend to be higher indoors in cities ) . Carbon dioxide also contributes to warming that causes sea-level rise , searing heat waves , and superstorms .\n\n`` As a scientist , what concerns me the most is what this continued rise actually means : that we are continuing full speed ahead with an unprecedented experiment with our planet , the only home we have , '' Katharine Hayhoe , a climate scientist , said on Twitter .\n\nBreathing the air of a new world\nFor the 800,000 years for which we have records , average global CO2 levels fluctuated between about 170 ppm and 280 ppm . Once humans started to burn fossil fuels in the industrial era , things changed rapidly .\n\nOnly in the industrial era has the number risen above 300 ppm . The concentration first crept above 400 ppm in 2013 , and it continues to climb .\n\nThere 's a debate among scientists about the last time CO2 levels were this high . It might have been during the Pliocene era , 2 million to 4.6 million years ago , when sea levels were 60 to 80 feet higher than today . Or it may have been in the Miocene , 10 million to 14 million years ago , when seas were more than 100 feet higher than now .\n\nIn our 800,000-year record , it took about 1,000 years for CO2 levels to increase by 35 ppm . We 're currently averaging an increase of more than 2 ppm a year , meaning we could hit an average of 500 ppm within the next 45 years .\n\nCO2 does n't directly harm human health at these concentrations . But because it traps heat on the planet that then cranks up the global thermostat , it can have a very significant effect on health .\n\nGlobal temperature tracks very closely to atmospheric levels of CO2 . The potential effects of higher average temperatures include tens of thousands of deaths from heat waves , more extreme weather events , and the spread of diseases carried by ticks and mosquitoes — something we 're already seeing . ( There 's a full list of possible ways climate change will affect human health on an archived Environmental Protection Agency page . )\n\nHigher levels of CO2 and the warming they cause also exacerbate ozone pollution . One 2008 study found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises because of CO2 levels , ozone pollution can be expected to kill an additional 22,000 people via respiratory illness , asthma , and emphysema .\n\nHumans have never had to breathe air that 's this polluted . Increased air pollution has been shown to cause lung cancer , cardiovascular disease , and higher rates of allergies and asthma . A recent study found that 9 million people died prematurely from pollution-related diseases in 2015 , accounting for 16 % of all deaths worldwide .\n\nOther research has raised even more concerns . The average CO2 level does n't represent the air most of us breathe . Cities tend to have far more CO2 than average — and those levels rise even higher indoors . Some research indicates that it may have a negative effect on human cognition and decision-making .\n\nFor these reasons , President Barack Obama 's EPA ruled in 2009 that CO2 was a pollutant that needed to be regulated under the Clean Air Act . But the Trump administration is reevaluating that ruling .\n\nDrowning in CO2\nThe human-health effects of CO2 increases are just one part of the bigger story here .\n\nThe change we 've seen in CO2 levels recently has been much more rapid than the historical trends . Some experts think we 're on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century , which could cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius . For context , the increase in superstorms , rising sea levels , and spreading tick-borne disease that we 're already seeing comes after a 0.9-degree rise .\n\nProjections of sea-level rise will also get more extreme as CO2 levels continue to climb .\n\nRight now , carbon-dioxide emissions are still rising . The goal set in the Paris agreement on climate change is to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius or less . But as a recent feature in the journal Nature revealed , we 're on track for more than 3 degrees of warming .\n\nThe latest measurements show that if we want to avoid that dangerous scenario , we need to make dramatic changes very quickly .", "label": [[208, 369, "Ad Populum"], [3540, 3769, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3991, 4204, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1506, 1632, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1659, 1809, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2123, 2230, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4399, 4544, "Ad Populum"], [5965, 6090, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3269, 3468, "Needs Discussion"]], "source_url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/carbon-dioxide-record-human-health-effects-2018-5", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/business-insider-highlights-health-impacts-climate-change-aspects-are-misleading-kevin-loria/"}
{"id": 480, "data": "One powerful polar bear fact is slowly rising above the message of looming catastrophe repeated endlessly by the media : More than 15,000 polar bears have not disappeared since 2005 . Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050 , the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn ’ t happen . Rather , global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved . The polar bear ’ s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom , but it didn ’ t . The alarmism is not going away without a struggle .\n\nPart of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science . My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers . For example , Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart , depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet . But that fact , documented in more than a dozen scientific papers , is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology . In these days of politicized science , neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea ; instead , they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice , which they argued depleted the bears ’ prey . There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16 , with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming .\n\nThe polar bear 's resilience should have meant the end of its use as an icon of global warming doom\n\nOne reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup ( now at Polar Bears International , an NGO ) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice , despite the Beaufort Sea experience . Moreover , Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear ’ s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears ’ prey .\n\nConsequently , many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals ( the primary prey of polar bears ) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season , which is particularly conducive to fishing : These seals do most of their feeding in summer . More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’ s probably true throughout the Arctic .\n\nAs long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring , they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast . And while it ’ s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice .\n\nNot all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year . The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year , the isolated nature of the incident , and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously .\n\nThat starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world . But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000 , or about 26,000 , up slightly from 20,000-25,000 , or about 22,500 , in 2005 . Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total . This increase may not be statistically significant , but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed .\n\nThe failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction . Although starving-bear videos and scientifically insignificant research papers still make the news , they don ’ t alter the facts : Polar bears are thriving , making them phony icons , and false idols , for global warming alarmists .", "label": [[446, 625, "Intentional"], [722, 917, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2809, 2963, "Faulty Generalization"], [3103, 3348, "Intentional"], [3578, 3816, "Faulty Generalization"], [3819, 4065, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4742, 4879, "Logical Fallacy"], [722, 918, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2809, 2964, "False Causality"], [3670, 3817, "Faulty Generalization"], [290, 368, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2105, 2219, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4579, 4738, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [5014, 5113, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/polar-bears-keep-thriving-even-as-global-warming-alarmists-keep-pretending-theyre-dying", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-publishes-misleading-opinion-misrepresents-science-polar-bears-peril-susan-crockford/"}
{"id": 481, "data": "( CNN ) Sea level rise is happening now , and the rate at which it is rising is increasing every year , according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\n\nResearchers , led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem , used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world 's oceans .\n\nUsing satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level , since it provides measurements of the open ocean .\nThe team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters ( 2.8 inches ) in 25 years of data , which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters ( 0.1 inches ) per year .\nBut that rate is not constant .\nContinuous emissions of greenhouse gases are warming the Earth 's atmosphere and oceans and melting its ice , causing the rate of sea level rise to increase .\n`` This acceleration , driven mainly by accelerated melting in Greenland and Antarctica , has the potential to double the total sea level rise by 2100 as compared to projections that assume a constant rate , to more than 60 centimeters instead of about 30 , '' said Nerem , who is also a fellow with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science .\n\nThat projection agrees perfectly with climate models used in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report , which show sea level rise to be between 52 and 98 centimeters by 2100 for a `` business as usual '' scenario ( in which greenhouse emissions continue without reduction ) .\nTherefore , scientists now have observed evidence validating climate model projections , as well as providing policy-makers with a `` data-driven assessment of sea level change that does not depend on the climate models , '' Nerem said .\nSea level rise of 65 centimeters , or roughly 2 feet , would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world . Extreme water levels , such as high tides and surges from strong storms , would be made exponentially worse .\nConsider the record set in Boston Harbor during January 's `` bomb cyclone '' or the inundation regularly experienced in Miami during the King tides ; these are occurring with sea levels that have risen about a foot in the past 100 years .\n\nNow , researchers say we could add another 2 feet by the end of this century .\nNerem and his team took into account natural changes in sea level thanks to cycles such as El Niño/La Niña and even events such as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo , which altered sea levels worldwide for several years .\nThe result is a `` climate-change-driven '' acceleration : the amount the sea levels are rising because of the warming caused by manmade global warming .\nThe researchers used data from other scientific missions such as GRACE , the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment , to determine what was causing the rate to accelerate .\n\nNASA 's GRACE mission used satellites to measure changes in ice mass . This image shows areas of Antarctica that gained or lost ice between 2002 and 2016 .\nCurrently , over half of the observed rise is the result of `` thermal expansion '' : As ocean water warms , it expands , and sea levels rise . The rest of the rise is the result of melted ice in Greenland and Antarctica and mountain glaciers flowing into the oceans .\nTheirs is a troubling finding when considering the recent rapid ice loss in the ice sheets .\n`` Sixty-five centimeters is probably on the low end for 2100 , '' Nerem said , `` since it assumes the rate and acceleration we have seen over the last 25 years continues for the next 82 years . ''\n\n`` We are already seeing signs of ice sheet instability in Greenland and Antarctica , so if they experience rapid changes , then we would likely see more than 65 centimeters of sea level rise by 2100 .

From the time he was a child growing up in Canada 's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild . But the emaciated polar bear , featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5 , was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he 's ever seen .\n\n`` We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks , '' he said .\n\nVideo shows the polar bear clinging to life , its white hair limply covering its thin , bony frame .

Looking for food , the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers . It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground .\n\nIn the days since Nicklen posted the footage , he 's been asked why he didn ’ t intervene .\n\n`` Of course , that crossed my mind , '' said Nicklen . `` But it 's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat .

''\n\nThe Climate Change Link ?\nBy telling the story of one polar bear , Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences .\n\nPolar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change . As animals that live only in Arctic regions , they 're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas .\n\nThe large , half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice . During summer months , it 's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify .\n\nIn 2002 , a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction . Even then , the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer , unhealthily extending the bears ' fasting season . By the end of summer , most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation .\n\nFifteen years later , polar bears ' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape . The National Snow and Ice Data Center , which tracks sea ice cover annually , has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse .

{"id": 487, "data": "It really is hard to overstate how screwed Florida is when it comes to climate change . Sea level rise has already ensured that floods are becoming common , not freak weather extremes ; it ’ s guaranteeing that hurricanes and their associated storm surges are just getting that much more powerful .\n\nDespite all this evidence , however , Governors and Senators who are often climate change deniers still get voted back into power there . As a result , instead of investing in climate change prevention measures , streets in Miami are literally getting raised up off the ground to stop floodwater coming in .\n\nA new study , published in Geophysical Research Letters , suggests that even this ludicrously short-sighted measure won ’ t be enough to stop the incoming tide . Sea level rise around the globe is accelerating year-on-year , but along the Floridian coastline , it ’ s rising up three to six times faster than average .\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida took into account a wide range of factors when it came to determining why this was happening . After all , regional sea level rise changes are very complex , and no single mechanism is solely to blame .\n\nWhen it comes to human influence , there are two inputs : the melting ice caps , and thermal expansion . The former is obvious – terrestrial ice that melts , falls into the sea and disintegrates causes the sea level to rise first in the region , and then globally .\n\nThe latter relates to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ; the more there is , the hotter the planet ’ s surface gets , and the hotter the oceans get . Warm water expands , and normally the only way to expand is upwards .\n\nWhen it comes to natural cycles , sea level changes take place on short timescales normally because an oceanic current , one that shifts water from place to place , has changed . El Niño , the epic and all-encompassing climatic phenomenon that takes place every 2-7 years , can affect these oceanic currents .\n\nThis new study suggests that Florida ’ s sea level rise “ hot spot ” is being caused mostly by these natural factors . A recent , particularly powerful El Niño and a sudden weakening in the atmospheric pressure over the region - thanks to a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation - conspired to allow water levels to rise sharply .\n\n“ The superposition of these two ocean-atmospheric processes accounts for 87 % of the variance in the spatiotemporal pattern of intradecadal sea level oscillations , ” the team note – meaning that by far , natural processes are responsible for this unusual hot spot of sea level rise .\n\nIt can not be ignored , though , that human contributions to climate change are only exacerbating this further . All in all , it ’ s bad news for Florida ’ s near-future , which is set to be underwater faster than anyone has previously estimated .\n\nAnother study revealed that , by 2100 , there will be 2 billion climate refugees – and several million of them will be migrating from Florida to places further inland . If that ’ s not the future you want , it ’ s probably best to vote for lawmakers who ’ ll do something about it .", "label": [[300, 435, "Ad Hominem"], [691, 717, "Ad Hominem"], [2744, 2863, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2907, 3033, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [300, 435, "Logical Fallacy"], [513, 605, "Intentional"], [2744, 2863, "Faulty Generalization"], [2867, 3033, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3036, 3147, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "http://www.iflscience.com/environment/the-sea-level-around-florida-is-rising-six-times-faster-than-average/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/iflscience-story-florida-sea-level-rise-somewhat-unclear-generally-correct/"}
{"id": 488, "data": "Marking another milestone for a changing planet , scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016 , trouncing a record set only a year earlier , which beat one set in 2014 . It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row .\n\nThe findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor ’ s efforts to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases .\n\nIn reality , the Earth is heating up , a point long beyond serious scientific dispute , but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling . Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization .\n\nIn 2015 and 2016 , the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño , in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere . But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long-term trend of rising temperatures , which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .\n\n“ A single warm year is something of a curiosity , ” said Deke Arndt , chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . “ It ’ s really the trend , and the fact that we ’ re punching at the ceiling every year now , that is the real indicator that we ’ re undergoing big changes . ”\n\nThe heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic , with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean . Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years , and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems , such as rapid coastal erosion , caused by the changing climate .\n\n“ What ’ s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive ; this year was ridiculously off the chart , ” said Gavin A. Schmidt , head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan , a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures .\n\nBut Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat . Drought and starvation afflicted Africa . On May 19 , the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India , 123.8 degrees Fahrenheit .\n\nEl Niño has now ended , and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before . But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts , and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years .\n\nEven at current temperatures , billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean . The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions . Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace , and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding . Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored .\n\nThe finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies , two of them American and one British , that track measurements made by ships , buoys and land-based weather stations . They analyze the figures to correct for known problems , producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth . The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis .\n\nIn the British data set , 2016 set a record by only a small amount ; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA ’ s . NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures , and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason .\n\nNASA ’ s calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a half-degree Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016 . That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years , and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a three-year period in the NASA record , which begins in 1880 .\n\nThe findings about a record-warm year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project , a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments . That group , however , did not find that three records had been set in a row ; in its analysis , 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014 .\n\nIn addition to the surface measurements , satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface . Two groups that analyze these figures showed a record-warm 2016 in data going back to 1978 , though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin .\n\nSince 1880 , NOAA ’ s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row : in 1939 , 1940 and 1941 . The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades , however , that 1941 now ranks as only the 37th-warmest year on record .\n\nThe modern era of global warming began around 1970 , after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures , and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row . Of the 17 hottest years on record , 16 have now occurred since 2000 .\n\nTwo of the agencies that issued Wednesday ’ s figures , NOAA and NASA , will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by President-elect Donald J. Trump , who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science . In 2012 , Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter , “ The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive . ”\n\nFear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation . Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees have given no detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are likely to be , much less how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate .\n\nSince he was elected president , Mr. Trump has acknowledged there may be “ some connectivity ” between human activity and climate change , and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject .\n\nOn Wednesday , in questioning before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , Mr. Trump ’ s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt , said , “ I do not believe that climate change is a hoax. ” He did not , however , say whether he believed that Mr. Trump was wrong on climate change .\n\nThe three record-setting years in a row undercut longstanding claims by a handful of contrarian scientists that global warming stopped after 1998 . That argument was never backed by good statistical evidence , but it was highlighted repeatedly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016 .\n\nWhen the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account , global temperatures are rising relentlessly . Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day .\n\nIt is true that at the Earth ’ s surface , the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts . “ The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep , ” said Richard Seager , a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University . “ It never stopped . ”\n\nIn fact , the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago . Those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring fossil-fuel emissions under control .\n\nFor example , many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable , though they can not say how fast it will happen . A rise that large would drown most of the world ’ s coastal cities without heroic efforts to fortify them .", "label": [[5842, 5957, "False Causality"], [727, 873, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/science/earth-highest-temperature-record.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-news-coverage-2016-global-temperature-data-accurate-summary-justin-gillis/"}
{"id": 492, "data": "In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay , 2,500 miles from the tip of South America , two glaciers hold human civilization hostage .\n\nStretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long , these glaciers , named Pine Island and Thwaites , have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea , part of the vast Southern Ocean . Further inland , the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas .\n\nThere ’ s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms . The vital question is when .\n\nThe glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica . ( A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “ The Doomsday Glacier. ” ) Together , they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world ’ s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet . For that reason , finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today .\n\nTo figure that out , scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age , about 11,000 years ago , when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels . The bad news ? There ’ s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then , flooding the world ’ s coastlines — partially the result of something called “ marine ice-cliff instability . ”\n\nThe ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica , so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs . Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can ’ t support their own weight . Once they start to crumble , the destruction would be unstoppable .\n\n“ Ice is only so strong , so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height , ” explains Kristin Poinar , a glaciologist at NASA ’ s Goddard Space Flight Center . “ We need to know how fast it ’ s going to happen . ”\n\nIn the past few years , scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century — much more quickly than previously thought .\n\nMinute-by-minute , huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea , as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building . The result : a global catastrophe the likes of which we ’ ve never seen .\n\nIce comes in many forms , with different consequences when it melts . Floating ice , like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves , doesn ’ t raise sea levels . ( Think of a melting ice cube , which won ’ t cause a drink to spill over . )\n\nLand-based ice , on the other hand , is much more troublesome . When it falls into the ocean , it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas . Thus , sea-level rise .\n\nAntarctica is a giant landmass — about half the size of Africa — and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick . Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming , the continent ’ s ice was in relative balance : The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges .\n\nNow , as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet , the scales have tipped .\n\nA wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe . Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers . All over the world , high tides would creep higher , slowly burying every shoreline on the planet , flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees .\n\nAll this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt .\n\n“ With marine ice cliff instability , sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago , ” Poinar says .\n\nA lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists : Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University . A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica .\n\nTheir results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher . “ Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse , ” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature , a publication not known for hyperbole .\n\nInstead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century , six feet was more likely , according to DeConto and Pollard ’ s findings . But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario , the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up , their study showed .\n\nThree feet of sea-level rise would be bad , leading to more frequent flooding of U.S. cities such as New Orleans , Houston , New York , and Miami . Pacific Island nations , like the Marshall Islands , would lose most of their territory . Unfortunately , it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios .\n\nAt six feet , though , around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced , and the world ’ s most vulnerable megacities , like Shanghai , Mumbai , and Ho Chi Minh City , could be wiped off the map .\n\nAt 11 feet , land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater . South Florida would be largely uninhabitable ; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey , as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings .\n\nDeConto and Pollard ’ s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior .\n\nAround 3 million years ago , when global temperatures were about as warm as they ’ re expected to be later this century , oceans were dozens of feet higher than today .\n\nPrevious models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur . But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability , DeConto and Pollard ’ s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “ business as usual ” path — meaning we don ’ t dramatically reduce carbon emissions .\n\nRapid cuts in greenhouse gases , however , showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years .\n\nPollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude , but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode .\n\n“ It could happen faster or slower , I don ’ t think we really know yet , ” says Jeremy Bassis , a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan . “ But it ’ s within the realm of possibility , and that ’ s kind of a scary thing . ”\n\nScientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates . These are , after all , mile-thick chunks of ice .\n\nThe new evidence , though , says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached , ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea , like those near Pine Island Bay , will begin to melt from both above and below , weakening their structure and hastening their demise , and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in .\n\nIn a new study out last month in the journal Nature , a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor , indicating that Pine Island ’ s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age .\n\nThe only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland , one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world . DeConto says that to construct their model , they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn , cut it in half to be extra conservative , then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island .\n\nBut there ’ s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn .\n\nRight now , there ’ s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers , helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea . But recent examples from other regions , like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula , show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming , their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea , an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland , too .\n\n“ If you remove the ice shelf , there ’ s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring , but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities , ” says Matthew Wise , a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge .\n\nThis signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century . “ Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice , ” Wise says , “ it just falls off . ”\n\nAnd , it ’ s not just Pine Island Bay . On our current course , other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable . And then there ’ s Greenland , which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts .\n\nNext to a meteor strike , rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself . This is about as fast as climate change gets .\n\nStill , some scientists aren ’ t fully convinced the alarm is warranted . Ted Scambos , lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado , says the new research by Wise and his colleagues , which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago , is “ tantalizing evidence. ” But he says that research doesn ’ t establish how quickly it happened .\n\n“ There ’ s a whole lot more to understand if we ’ re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat , ” he says . “ The question boils down to , what are the brakes on this process ? ”\n\nScambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once . For one thing , if rapid collapse did happen , it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf , slowing down the rate of retreat .\n\nDespite the differences of opinion , however , there ’ s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise . In 2015 , the U.S. and U.K. governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier . Called “ How much , how fast ? , ” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years .\n\nSeeing the two governments pooling their resources is “ really a sign of the importance of research like this , ” NASA ’ s Poinar says .\n\nGiven what ’ s at stake , the research program at Thwaites isn ’ t enough , but it might be the most researchers can get . “ Realistically , it ’ s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment , ” says Pollard .\n\nHe ’ s referring , of course , to the Trump administration ’ s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding ; the White House ’ s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation , which typically funds research in Antarctica .\n\n“ It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this , from my perspective , ” Pollard says . Structural engineers need to study Antarctica ’ s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building , he says , probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail . “ If you vastly increase the research now , [ the cost ] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen . ”\n\nBassis , the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan , first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago .\n\nHe ’ s 40 years old , but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career . In 2002 , when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica , he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight .\n\n“ Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought , ” he says . “ We didn ’ t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat , we didn ’ t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate . We tend to look at these things after they ’ ve happened . ”\n\nThere ’ s a recurring theme throughout these scientists ’ findings in Antarctica : What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse . A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries .

However , with latest projections pointing to an increase of 3.2C by 2100 , these goals seem to be slipping out of reach .\n\nGlobal temperature change\ncompared to pre-industrial levels\n\n“ [ We ] still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future , ” said Erik Solheim , the UN environment chief , ahead of the upcoming Bonn conference .\n\nOne of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea-level rise , caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles .\n\nScientists at the non-profit organisation Climate Central estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming .\n\nAsian cities will be worst affected\nThe regional impact of these changes is highly uneven , with four out of five people affected living in Asia .\n\n\nAlthough sea levels will not rise instantaneously , the calculated increases will be “ locked in ” at a temperature rise of 3C , meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down .\n\nOsaka , Japan\n5.2 million people affected\n\nAt the end of a month in which it has been battered by unseasonably late typhoons and relentless rain , Japan is already confronting the threat posed by climate change-induced flooding .\n\nImage modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world , threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region ’ s 19 million residents .\n\nMillions of people live in the urban area surrounding Osaka . Sea-level rise will reshape densely and sparsely populated areas .\n\nAs a result of global sea-level rise , storm surges and other factors , economists project that coastal flooding could put almost $ 1tn of Osaka ’ s assets at risk by the 2070s , according to the Union of Concerned Scientists .\n\n“ The costs of protecting cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise - as are the costs of repairing storm damage , ” it said . “ Decisions we make today could have a profound impact on the security and culture of the people of this ancient city . ”\n\nLike much of Japan , Osaka already has a network of seawalls and other coastal defences in place to combat tsunami – although their effectiveness was disputed in the aftermath of the 2011 triple disaster .\n\nOsaka city authorities are investing in other infrastructure to mitigate the effects of flooding , but public education is also vital , according to Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government ’ s environment bureau .\n\n“ In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming , but given that climate change is inevitable , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow , ” Nakaaki said .\n\n“ We anticipate that Osaka will be affected by natural disasters caused by climate change , but we have yet to establish exactly what might happen or how much financial damage they would cause .\n\n“ It ’ s not that we expect sea levels to rise at some point in the future – they are already rising . ”\n\nKeiko Kanai has long been aware that her home city is susceptible to natural disasters . “ I ’ d heard that historically , tsunamis caused by earthquakes put many parts of Osaka underwater , and I knew that some parts of the world were at risk from rising sea levels , ” said Kanai , who teaches at a local university .\n\n“ But I didn ’ t put two and two together . Until now I haven ’ t given much thought to the idea that Osaka too could be engulfed by rising sea levels . ”\n\nKaori Akazawa , a nursing care consultant , said flooding was a consideration when she was deciding where in Osaka to live .\n\n“ When I moved here I talked to my colleagues about the risks , ” she said . “ That ’ s why I ’ ve always rented apartments on the fourth storey or higher .\n\n“ It ’ s worrying , but I ’ ve never considered moving . ”\n\nJustin McCurry in Tokyo\n\nAlexandria , Egypt\n3 million people affected\n\nOn the Alexandria Corniche , waves slowly lap at a shoreline dotted with plastic chairs and umbrellas from the beachside cafes . Students perch on the steps of the imposing Alexandria library . But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming .\n\n\nThe IPCC reported that Alexandria ’ s beaches would be submerged even with a 0.5-metre sea-level rise , while 8 million people would be displaced by flooding in Alexandria and the Nile Delta if no protective measures are taken . A 3C world threatens far greater damage than that .\n\nYet for many residents , there is little public information to connect the increasingly chaotic weather and floods with climate change . “ The vast majority of Alexandrians don ’ t have access to knowledge , and that ’ s what worries me . I don ’ t expect the government to raise awareness of this problem until it ’ s already happening , ” said 22-year-old student Kareem Mohammed .\n\n“ Everyone thinks we should act on this problem 50 or 80 years from now , ” agreed his friend , Hazem Hassan , a student in marine biology at the nearby Alexandria University .\n\nOfficials maintain that protective measures are being taken , but with little fanfare . “ Egypt spends 700m EGP [ £30m ] annually to protect the north coast , ” said Dr Magdy Allam , head of the Arab Environmental Experts Union , who was previously part of the Egyptian environment ministry .\n\nAllam cited the Mohammed Ali sea wall built in 1830 as a key protection , as well as the concrete blocks lining the shoreline designed to “ detour flood water away from residential neighbourhoods ” . But critics say that this is far from enough given the scale of the problem .\n\n“ There are studies indicating that our city is one of many coastal human settlements around the world which will be partially submerged by 2070 if nothing is done , ” said Ahmed Hassan , of the Save Alexandria Initiative , a group that works to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on the city .\n\nRuth Michaelson in Alexandria\n\nRio de Janeiro , Brazil\n1.8 million people affected\n\nResidents of Brazil ’ s postcard city have plenty of reasons to fear global warming – even if they don ’ t quite know it . According to Climate Central , a temperature rise of 3C would cause flooding of not just Rio ’ s famous beaches such as Copacabana and its waterfront domestic airport , but also inland areas of the Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood , where last year ’ s Olympic Games were held .\n\n\nBarra is built around a network of heavily polluted lagoons that empty into the sea . The prospect of it being underwater alarmed resident Sueli Gonçalves , 46 , who runs pensioners ’ health projects , as she and her 23-year-old son Yuri Sanchez carried their shopping past the Olympic Park .\n\n“ My God . Oh Jesus , ” she said , with a nervous laugh . “ I will leave here . I will go to the United States . To Canada . ”\n\nThe family knew about global warming but were unaware of the potential scale of the impact on their upscale neighbourhood of smart condominiums and a shopping mall .\n\n“ Nobody takes it seriously . People do not think long term , ” Gonçalves said .\n\nStorm surges recently destroyed hundreds of metres of beachfront pavement overlooking the Macumba beach , a popular surfing spot on Rio ’ s western fringes . Last year , heavy waves in another storm surge felled an elevated , clifftop cycle path between Leblon beach and Barra de Tijuca which had not been built to survive such high seas , killing two people .\n\nLast year , Rio ’ s city government and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro produced a study entitled Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change .\n\n“ The current challenge consists in deepening knowledge and monitoring of oceanic phenomena and the evolution of the sea bed and coast , ” a spokeswoman for the city ’ s secretariat of the environment said in an email . An “ adaption plan ” for climate change produced with professors from the federal university suggested strategies to deal with vulnerabilities in areas such as transport , health and housing . But so far little has been done .\n\nNara Pinto , 38 , who lives in the sprawling Rocinha favela and sells snacks on the pavement overlooking Copacabana beach , said the loss of Rio ’ s famous beaches would cost a lot of jobs .\n\n“ The beach is a tourist point , ” she said . “ What can be done to stop this ?\n\nDom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro\n\nShanghai , China\n17.5 million people affected\n\n“ Shanghai is completely gone – I ’ d have to move to Tibet ! ” says resident Wang Liubin , when he is shown projections for the city after 3C of global warming .\n\nWhen it comes to flooding , the coastal city is one of the world ’ s most vulnerable . Now one of the world ’ s biggest ports , the former fishing village is bordered by the Yangtze river in the north and divided through the middle by the Huangpu river ; the municipality involves several islands , two long coastlines , shipping ports , and miles of canals , rivers , and waterways .\n\n\nIn 2012 , a report from a team of UK and Dutch scientists declared Shanghai the most vulnerable major city in the world to serious flooding , based on factors such as numbers of people living close to the coastline , time needed to recover from flooding , and measures to prevent floodwater . According to Climate Central projections , 17.5 million people could be displaced by rising waters if global temperatures increase by 3C .\n\nProjections show the vast majority of the city could eventually be submerged in water , including much of the downtown area , landmarks such as the Lujiazui skyline and the historical Bund , both airports , and the entirety of its outlying Chongming Island .\n\nSince 2012 , the government has been making steady inroads to tackle the threat , including building China ’ s largest deepwater drainage system beneath the Suzhou Creek waterway , made up of 15km of pipes to drain rainwater across a 58 sq km area . It has also rolled out a 40bn yuan ( £5bn ) River Flood Discharge project which will stretch for 120km between Lake Taihu and the Huangpu river to try and mitigate the risk of the upstream lake flooding .\n\nFlood prevention walls are being built along the waterfront – in places so high the river is blocked from view – and 200km more are promised across the city ’ s outlying districts . Flood controls have been put in place along the famous Bund waterfront , where the walkway has been raised to help counter a flood risk , as well as a series of water controls and dams .\n\nHelen Roxburgh in Shanghai\n\nMiami , US\n2.7 million people affected\n\nFew other cities in the world have as much to lose from rising sea levels as Miami , and the alarm bells sound ever louder with each successive “ king tide ” that overwhelms coastal defences and sends knee-deep seawater coursing through downtown streets .\n\n\nLocals consider this the “ new normal ” in the biggest city of Florida ’ s largest metropolitan area , which would simply cease to exist with a 3C temperature rise . Even at 2C , forecasts show almost the entire bottom third of Florida – the area south of Lake Okeechobee currently home to more than 7 million people - submerged , with grim projections for the rest of the state in a little more than half a century . In Miami-Dade county alone , almost $ 15bn of coastal property is at risk of flooding in just the next 15 years .\n\nA sense of urgency is evident at city hall , where commissioners are asking voters to approve a “ Miami Forever ” bond in the November ballot that includes $ 192m for upgrading pump stations , improving drainage and raising sea walls .\n\n“ We have a really precious city that many people love and are willing to invest in right now , but it ’ s going to take some funds to protect it , ” said Ken Russell , the city commission ’ s vice-chair .\n\nLast year , the city of Miami appointed sea-rise expert Jane Gilbert into the newly created role of chief resilience officer with instructions for a robust stormwater management plan that also looks at storm surge , such as that from Hurricane Irma in September which brought significant flooding to downtown Brickell and neighbouring Coconut Grove .\n\nProposals include elevating roads and even abandoning neighbourhoods to the water to protect others .\n\n“ We need universal recognition that we ’ re all in this together , to protect this amazing global city that we ’ ve become , ” she said .\n\nNatalia Ortiz , who grew up in Miami , fears the future . “ It ’ s very scary , ” said Ortiz , who works with Cleo , a climate change advocacy group . “ My son is 11 and my daughter is nine , so they ’ re young but I think about their future , will they be able to raise their children in Miami the way I had the luxury of raising mine ? ”\n\nRichard Luscombe in Miami\n\nMethodology\n\nFlood maps were created using sea-level rise estimates from Climate Central and digital elevation data .

{"id": 494, "data": "Global warming might be far worse than we thought , according to a new study .\n\nThe research challenges the ways that researchers have worked out sea temperatures until now , meaning that they may be increasing quicker than previously suggested .\n\nThe methodology widely used to understand sea temperatures in the scientific community may be based on a mistake , the new study suggests , and so our understanding of climate change might be fundamentally flawed .\n\nThe new research suggests that the oceans hundreds of millions of years ago were much cooler than we thought . If true , that means that the global warming we are currently undergoing is unparallelled within the last 100 million years , and far worse than we had previously calculated .\n\nUntil now , scientists believed that the temperature of the ocean depths and the surface of the polar ocean 100 million years ago were about 15 degrees warmer than they are today . But they might in fact have stayed relatively stable – making the warming we 're currently undergoing far more alarming .\n\n`` If we are right , our study challenges decades of paleoclimate research , '' said Anders Meibom , the head of EPFL 's Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry and a professor at the University of Lausanne .\n\n`` Oceans cover 70 % of our planet . They play a key role in the earth 's climate . Knowing the extent to which their temperatures have varied over geological time is crucial if we are to gain a fuller understanding of how they behave and to predict the consequences of current climate change more accurately . ''\n\nThe researchers believe that scientists have been overlooking crucial processes when they calculated the temperature of the seas millions of years ago . In so doing , they may have been mistakenly thinking that they were warmer than they actually are .\n\nUntil now , scientists have calculated the temperature of the ancient seas by looking at foraminifera , the fossils of tiny marine organisms found in the sediment on the ocean floor . Those form small shells and take on more or less of an oxygen isotope depending on how warm the water is , so by looking at the oxygen content they can estimate the temperature when those fossils were around .\n\nThat working led scientists to believe that the temperature of the seas had fallen by 15 degrees over the last 100 million years .\n\nBut the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells does n't actually remain constant over time . The new research showed that they can change – and without leaving any visible trace that would alert scientists to that change .\n\n`` What appeared to be perfectly preserved fossils are in fact not . This means that the paleotemperature estimates made up to now are incorrect , '' said Sylvain Bernard , a CNRS researcher at the Paris-based Institute of Mineralogy , Materials Physics and Cosmochemistry and the study 's lead author .\n\nThe scientists behind the study claim that the apparent cooling of the oceans was actually just the effect of the process they 've seen . The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells is n't a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway .\n\nThe French and Swiss researchers behind the paper have already got to work trying to understand what the temperatures actually are . `` To revisit the ocean 's paleotemperatures now , we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration , which has been overlooked for too long . For that , we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time , '' said Professor Meibom .\n\nThe research was conducted by French researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) , Sorbonne University and the University of Strasbourg , and Swiss researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne ( EPFL ) and the University of Lausanne .

{"id": 498, "data": "A new report published by a team of prominent climate scientists confirms what many skeptics have pointed out for years : the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming `` hiatus , '' over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures .\n\nThe report , published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18 , acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the `` slowdown '' in warming post-2000 , resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 `` emissions budget '' for the coming decades . The report in part intends to `` reset '' the estimations for the new predictions on when the earth will hit what the U.N. has determined to be dangerous warming levels .\n\nThe team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming `` hiatus '' in the beginning of the 21st century , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) models overestimated temperature increases , consequently setting key benchmarks for warming earlier than they need to be , given the actual numbers .\n\n`` The models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions , '' University of Exerter 's Pierre Friedlingstein , one of the study 's authors , told The Washington Post . `` So , therefore , they derive a budget which is much lower , '' he added .\n\nAnother co-author , the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ' Joeir Rogelj , explained to the Post that the models used by the IPCC have made two mistakes : `` slightly overestimat [ ing ] historical warming '' and `` underestimat [ ing ] compatible historical CO2 emissions ''\n\n`` These two small discrepancies accumulate over time and lead to an slight underestimation of the remaining carbon budget , '' said Rogelj . The new study , he said , attempts to `` reset the uncertainties , starting from where we are today . ''\n\nThe report follows a study by another team of climate scientists published in June 2017 that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was `` generally smaller than trends estimated '' from the models . Here 's the abstract of the study :\n\nIn the early twenty-first century , satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble . Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability , such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur . Here we analyse global-mean tropospheric temperatures from satellites and climate model simulations to examine whether warming rate differences over the satellite era can be explained by internal climate variability alone . We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century , differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability . Over most of the early twenty-first century , however , model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed ; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability . The probability that multi-decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century results is low ( between zero and about 9 % ) . It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity . We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations .\n\nThe Daily Caller notes a few other reports by climate scientists in the last few years that have likewise underscored the climate models ' overestimation of warming , with one determining that the models have predicted 2.5 times more warming than has actually been observed :\n\nCato Institute scientists Patrick Michaels and Chip Knappenberger have noted the climate models have been over-hyping warming for decades . Scientist John Christy of the University of Alabama-Huntsville has testified before Congress on the matter .\n\nChristy ’ s research has shown climate models show 2.5 times more warming in the bulk atmosphere than has been observed . ...\n\n[ The ] author and atmospheric scientist Ryan Maue wrote about the new “ consensus ” on global warming in the wake of a June study by prominent climate scientists .\n\nThat study found “ satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble . ”", "label": [[635, 805, "Intentional"], [1360, 1417, "False Causality"], [121, 313, "False Causality"], [1144, 1247, "False Causality"], [0, 312, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [316, 632, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4063, 4309, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "http://www.dailywire.com/news/21275/climate-scientists-climate-models-have-james-barrett#", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-wire-article-misunderstands-study-carbon-budget-along-fox-news-telegraph-daily-mail-breitbart-james-barrett/"}
{"id": 499, "data": "This wasn ’ t supposed to be a bad year for Western wildfires .\n\nLast winter , a weak La Niña bloomed across the Pacific . It sent flume after flume of rain to North America and irrigated half the continent . Water penetrated deep into the soil of Western forests , and mammoth snowdrifts stacked up across the Sierra Nevadas . California ’ s drought ended in the washout .\n\nYet fires are now raging across the West . More than two dozen named fires currently burn across Washington and Oregon . More than one million acres have burned in Montana , an area larger than Rhode Island , in the Treasure State ’ s third-worst fire season on record . And the largest brushfire in the history of Los Angeles currently threatens hundreds of homes in Burbank .\n\nCanada may be experiencing an even worse year for wildfires : 2.86 million acres have burned in British Columbia , the largest area ever recorded in the province .\n\nSo what happened ? How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer ?\n\nThe answer lies in the summer ’ s record-breaking heat , say wildfire experts . Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July , and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August .\n\n“ This will become an important year for [ anecdotes about ] the importance of temperature . Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring , these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires , ” says Park Williams , a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University .\n\n“ This heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming . ”\n\nIn other words , the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms .\n\n“ The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry , the perfect recipe for drying out fuels ( the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems ) , ” said John Abatzoglou , a professor of geography at the University of Idaho , in an email . “ I was running a few numbers this morning , and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane , Washington , to Medford , Oregon ; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain . ”\n\nThis excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires . For more than three decades , wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity , which is controlled by heat , exist in an exponential relationship . Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming , Williams said .\n\n“ Now , thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change , we think that the western United States is 1.5 [ degrees ] Celsius , or 3 degrees Fahrenheit , hotter than it would be in absence of climate change . And there ’ s a heat wave on top of that , ” said Williams . “ Because of the exponential influence of temperature , that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming . ”\n\nIn the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming , wildfires are a “ canary in the coal mine ” for the effects of climate change , Williams said .\n\nAnd global warming is already having an effect on wildfire . In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming .\n\n“ The added forest fire area—due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming—equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined , ” Williams told me .\n\nThe area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent .\n\nOther researchers have arrived at similar conclusions . A paper published in Science last year found that “ large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s , with higher large-wildfire frequency , longer wildfire durations , and longer wildfire seasons. ” The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt .\n\nThe same team of researchers also found that the area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent since the early 1970s .\n\nFires have not only been increasing in size due to climate change . In the early 20th century , state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible . This has caused denser and more fire-prone forests than the long-term average for the West , which has led to more massive and uncontrollable fires .\n\nPeople have also lengthened the season by starting fires—through errant fireworks , unattended campfires , or arson—earlier in the spring and later in the fall . In a human-free environment , fires could only start after a lightning strike , which only follow from summertime thunderstorms .\n\n“ Since the 1980s , we ’ ve only burnt about 10 percent of the western U.S. forests . And that number to me means that there ’ s still a whole lot more to burn , ” Williams said . He estimated that it would take another several decades for that excess century of fuel to burn out of the American woods . And in the meantime , the planet will only get hotter .\n\n“ According to climate models , by the end of this century , the western United States is still projected to warm by about another 3.5 degrees Celsius , ” he told me . “ And when we remember that the relationship between temperature and fire is exponential ... we ’ re really talking about a very different western United States in 50 years . ”", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/why-is-2017-so-bad-for-wildfires-climate-change/539130/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/global-warming-fire-suppression-practices-boost-wildfires-us-west-correctly-reported-the-atlantic-robinson-meyer/"}
{"id": 500, "data": "“ The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm . ”\n\nBy Robinson Meyer\n\nEvery so often , the worst-case scenario comes to pass .\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon , the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm . The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding : Interstates are under feet of water , local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts , and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage .\n\nSome models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night , dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area .\n\n“ Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record . The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before , ” said a statement from the National Weather Service . “ Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days. ” ( In years of weather reporting , I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous . )\n\nThis means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now . In an age when the climate is changing rapidly , a natural question to ask is : What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm ?\n\nClimate scientists , who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole , are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change . But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse .\n\nIt may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength . Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere . These gases prevent some of the sun ’ s rays from bouncing back into space , trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world .\n\nThis warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster , which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere . But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change ’ s effects on Harvey .\n\nStorms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change : As the air warms , some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean , which in turn raises the temperature of the sea ’ s upper layers .\n\nHarvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico . As the storm roared toward Houston last week , sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average . These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world . The tropical storm , feeding off this unusual warmth , was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours .\n\n“ This is the main fuel for the storm , ” says Kevin Trenberth , a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research . “ Although these storms occur naturally , the storm is apt to be more intense , maybe a bit bigger , longer-lasting , and with much heavier rainfalls [ because of that ocean heat ] . ”\n\nThis also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey ’ s strangest and scariest behaviors . The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall , achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast . This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico : It may be unique . In the past 30 years of records , no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall .\n\nHarvey is just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms .\n\nWhy do storms normally weaken—and why didn ’ t Harvey ? As mentioned above , hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters . But as they grow , their strong winds often pick up seawater , churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface . The same winds also bring newer , colder water closer to the atmosphere , which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm .\n\nThat didn ’ t happen with Harvey . The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface , said Trenberth , but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening . “ Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did , because it was so close to land . It ’ s amazing it was able to do that , ” he told me .\n\nAll of this said , a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change . Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston . Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season . Storms similar to it would form in any climate .\n\nBut Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful , overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems .\n\n“ The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm , ” he said . “ It may have been a strong storm , and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [ human-caused climate change ] amplifies the damage considerably . ”\n\nMore generally , it ’ s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean . A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “ medium confidence ” that human activities “ have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s . ”\n\nHouston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately . It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015 , according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus . The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s . Meanwhile , only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance , though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change .\n\nYet even compared to recent storms , Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms . Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison , the area ’ s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001 , though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm .\n\nAnd it will keep raining . As of Sunday afternoon , Buffalo Bayou , a major river near downtown Houston , is one foot above flood stage . It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone .", "label": [[1117, 1247, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3590, 3703, "Ad Populum"], [362, 533, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https:/www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/did-climate-change-intensify-hurricane-harvey/538158/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-accurately-explores-climate-context-tropical-storm-harvey-robinson-meyer/"}
{"id": 504, "data": "Normally , the hottest years on record occur when the underlying human-caused global warming trend gets a temporary boost from an El Niño ’ s enhanced warming in the tropical Pacific .\n\nSo it ’ s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reported Tuesday that the first half of 2017 was the second-warmest January-June on record for Earth , topped only by 2016 , which was boosted by one of the biggest El Niños on record .\n\n“ As if it wasn ’ t shocking enough to see three consecutive record-breaking years , in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , for the first time on record , ” leading climatologist Michael Mann wrote in an email to ThinkProgress , “ we ’ re now seeing near-record temperatures even in the absence of the El Nino ‘ assist ’ that the previous record year benefited from . ”\n\nNOAA climatologist Ahira Sanchez-Lugo told Climate Central , “ After the decline of the strong El Niño , I was expecting the values to drop a bit… . This year has been extremely remarkable . ”\n\nUsually we see global records in years when the short-term El Niño warming adds to the long-term global warming trend ( see chart below ) . As NOAA noted in its March report , without an El Niño , no month before March 2017 had ever exceeded the “ normal ” temperature ( the 1981–2010 average ) by a full 1.8°F ( 1.0°C ) .\n\nGlobal monthly temperature departures ( from 1981–2010 average ) color-coded by whether the Pacific was experiencing an El Niño ( red ) , a La Niña ( blue ) or neutral conditions ( gray ) .\n\nThis matters because when a month — or six-month period — sees record high global temperatures in the absence of an El Niño , that is a sign the underlying global warming trend is stronger than ever . The latest NOAA report is “ a reminder that climate change has not , despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘ paused ’ or even slowed down , ” Mann said .\n\nBottom line : Human-caused global warming continues at a dangerous pace , and only human action to slash carbon pollution can stop it .", "label": [[186, 315, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1999, 2132, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/no-el-nino-still-hot-39162a5cc5bc/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/2017-track-among-hottest-year-recorded-scientists-not-surprised-thinkprogress-article-suggests-joe-romm/"}
{"id": 505, "data": "I . ‘ Doomsday ’\nPeering beyond scientific reticence .\n\nIt is , I promise , worse than you think . If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise , you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible , even within the lifetime of a teenager today . And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming , and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic , that they have occluded our perception of other threats , many much closer at hand . Rising oceans are bad , in fact very bad ; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough .\n\nIndeed , absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives , parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable , and other parts horrifically inhospitable , as soon as the end of this century .\n\nEven when we train our eyes on climate change , we are unable to comprehend its scope . This past winter , a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole , melting the permafrost that encased Norway ’ s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “ Doomsday , ” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe , and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built .\n\nThe Doomsday vault is fine , for now : The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe . But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news . Until recently , permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists , because , as the name suggests , it was soil that stayed permanently frozen . But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon , more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth ’ s atmosphere . When it thaws and is released , that carbon may evaporate as methane , which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century ; when judged on the timescale of two decades , it is 86 times as powerful . In other words , we have , trapped in Arctic permafrost , twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet , all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up , partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over .\n\nMaybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day , like those , last month , that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought ( in fact , the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines ) . Or the news from Antarctica this past May , when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days , then kept going ; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this , it may already have met the open water , where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever , a process known poetically as “ calving . ”\n\nBut no matter how well-informed you are , you are surely not alarmed enough . Over the past decades , our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias , perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety , and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers , we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination . The reasons for that are many : the timid language of scientific probabilities , which the climatologist James Hansen once called “ scientific reticence ” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was ; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn ’ t even see warming as a problem worth addressing ; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings ; the simple speed of change and , also , its slowness , such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past ; our uncertainty about uncertainty , which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible ; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere , not everywhere ; the smallness ( two degrees ) and largeness ( 1.8 trillion tons ) and abstractness ( 400 parts per million ) of the numbers ; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult , if not impossible , to solve ; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem , which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation ; simple fear . But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial , too .\n\nIn between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself . This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency . But those scenarios , and not the present climate , are the baseline . In fact , they are our schedule .\n\nThe present tense of climate change — the destruction we ’ ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough . Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving ; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we ’ ll lose them within the century , even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade . Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe : tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world . Now two degrees is our goal , per the Paris climate accords , and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it . The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports , often called the “ gold standard ” of climate research ; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century , should we stay the present course . But that ’ s just a median projection . The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven ’ t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt . The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *\n\nThe Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .\n\nOver the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us . That is what Wallace Smith Broecker , the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “ global warming , ” means when he calls the planet an “ angry beast. ” You could also go with “ war machine. ” Each day we arm it more .\n\nII . Heat Death\nThe bahraining of New York .\n\nHumans , like all mammals , are heat engines ; surviving means having to continually cool off , like panting dogs . For that , the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant , drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping . At seven degrees of warming , that would become impossible for large portions of the planet ’ s equatorial band , and especially the tropics , where humidity adds to the problem ; in the jungles of Costa Rica , for instance , where humidity routinely tops 90 percent , simply moving around outside when it ’ s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal . And the effect would be fast : Within a few hours , a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out .\n\nClimate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before , but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow , even by the standards of planetary history . At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .\n\nActually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit . As soon as several decades from now , the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year .\n\nIt is not just the hajj , and it is not just Mecca ; heat is already killing us . In the sugarcane region of El Salvador , as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease , including over a quarter of the men , the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago . With dialysis , which is expensive , those with kidney failure can expect to live five years ; without it , life expectancy is in the weeks . Of course , heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys , too . As I type that sentence , in the California desert in mid-June , it is 121 degrees outside my door . It is not a record high .\n\nIII . The End of Food\nPraying for cornfields in the tundra .\n\nClimates differ and plants vary , but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming , yields decline by 10 percent . Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent . Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century , we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them . And proteins are worse : It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat , butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts .\n\nPollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature , and they are right — theoretically , a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland . But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown , the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain , and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity . And you can ’ t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles , because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there ; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt .\n\nDrought might be an even bigger problem than heat , with some of the world ’ s most arable land turning quickly to desert . Precipitation is notoriously hard to model , yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous : unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced . By 2080 , without dramatic reductions in emissions , southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought , much worse than the American dust bowl ever was . The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East ; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia , Africa , and South America ; and the breadbasket regions of China . None of these places , which today supply much of the world ’ s food , will be reliable sources of any . As for the original dust bowl : The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s , a 2015 NASA study predicted , but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300 , which “ dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains ” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization .\n\nRemember , we do not live in a world without hunger as it is . Far from it : Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million globally . In case you haven ’ t heard , this spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa and the Middle East ; the U.N. has warned that separate starvation events in Somalia , South Sudan , Nigeria , and Yemen could kill 20 million this year alone .\n\nIV . Climate Plagues\nWhat happens when the bubonic ice melts ?\n\nRock , in the right spot , is a record of planetary history , eras as long as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just inches , or just an inch , or even less . Ice works that way , too , as a climate ledger , but it is also frozen history , some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen . There are now , trapped in Arctic ice , diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases , since before humans were around to encounter them . Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice .\n\nThe Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times . In Alaska , already , researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world ’ s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone . As the BBC reported in May , scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice , too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness , left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun .\n\nExperts caution that many of these organisms won ’ t actually survive the thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already reanimated several of them — the 32,000-year-old “ extremophile ” bacteria revived in 2005 , an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007 , the 3.5 million–year–old one a Russian scientist self-injected just out of curiosity — to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the return of such ancient plagues . But already last year , a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier ; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected , too , carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra .\n\nWhat concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated , rewired , or even re-evolved by warming . The first effect is geographical . Before the early-modern period , when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs , human provinciality was a guard against pandemic . Today , even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations , our ecosystems are mostly stable , and this functions as another limit , but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did . You don ’ t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France . But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them , you will . You didn ’ t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago , either .\n\nAs it happens , Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation . One reason you hadn ’ t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda ; another is that it did not , until recently , appear to cause birth defects . Scientists still don ’ t entirely understand what happened , or what they missed . But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases : Malaria , for instance , thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do , too , but because for every degree increase in temperature , the parasite reproduces ten times faster . Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050 , 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it .\n\nV. Unbreathable Air\nA rolling death smog that suffocates millions .\n\nOur lungs need oxygen , but that is only a fraction of what we breathe . The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing : It just crossed 400 parts per million , and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100 . At that concentration , compared to the air we breathe now , human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent .\n\nOther stuff in the hotter air is even scarier , with small increases in pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years . The warmer the planet gets , the more ozone forms , and by mid-century , Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog , the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected . By 2090 , as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “ safe ” level ; one paper last month showed that , among other effects , a pregnant mother ’ s exposure to ozone raises the child ’ s risk of autism ( as much as tenfold , combined with other environmental factors ) . Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in West Hollywood .\n\nAlready , more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning ; each year , 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke , in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season ( in the U.S. , it ’ s increased by 78 days since 1970 ) . By 2050 , according to the U.S. Forest Service , wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today ; in some places , the area burned could grow fivefold . What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions , especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat . Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997 , for instance , added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent , and more burning only means more warming only means more burning . There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon , which in 2010 suffered its second “ hundred-year drought ” in the space of five years , could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating , rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest . That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen .\n\nThen there are the more familiar forms of pollution . In 2013 , melting Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns , depriving industrial China of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on , which blanketed much of the country ’ s north in an unbreathable smog . Literally unbreathable . A metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out at the 301-to-500 range , warning of “ serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly ” and , for all others , “ serious risk of respiratory effects ” ; at that level , “ everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion. ” The Chinese “ airpocalypse ” of 2013 peaked at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800 . That year , smog was responsible for a third of all deaths in the country .\n\nVI . Perpetual War\nThe violence baked into heat .\n\nClimatologists are very careful when talking about Syria . They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war , it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming ; next door , for instance , Lebanon suffered the same crop failures . But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence : For every half-degree of warming , they say , societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict . In climate science , nothing is simple , but the arithmetic is harrowing : A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today . Overall , social conflict could more than double this century .\n\nThis is one reason that , as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out , the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change : The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough , but being the world ’ s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles . Of course , it ’ s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict . Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global warming — a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the region ’ s oil .\n\nWhat accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict ? Some of it comes down to agriculture and economics ; a lot has to do with forced migration , already at a record high , with at least 65 million displaced people wandering the planet right now . But there is also the simple fact of individual irritability . Heat increases municipal crime rates , and swearing on social media , and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher , coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch , will hit an opposing batter in retaliation . And the arrival of air-conditioning in the developed world , in the middle of the past century , did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave .\n\nVII . Permanent Economic Collapse\nDismal capitalism in a half-poorer world .\n\nThe murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism , which prevailed between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession , is that economic growth would save us from anything and everything .\nBut in the aftermath of the 2008 crash , a growing number of historians studying what they call “ fossil capitalism ” have begun to suggest that the entire history of swift economic growth , which began somewhat suddenly in the 18th century , is not the result of innovation or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery of fossil fuels and all their raw power — a onetime injection of new “ value ” into a system that had previously been characterized by global subsistence living . Before fossil fuels , nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or ancestors from 500 years before , except in the immediate aftermath of a great plague like the Black Death , which allowed the lucky survivors to gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves . After we ’ ve burned all the fossil fuels , these scholars suggest , perhaps we will return to a “ steady state ” global economy . Of course , that onetime injection has a devastating long-term cost : climate change .\n\nThe most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come from Hsiang and his colleagues , who are not historians of fossil capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own : Every degree Celsius of warming costs , on average , 1.2 percent of GDP ( an enormous number , considering we count growth in the low single digits as “ strong ” ) . This is the sterling work in the field , and their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century ( resulting from changes in agriculture , crime , storms , energy , mortality , and labor ) .\nTracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier : There is a 12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by 2100 , they say , and a 51 percent chance that it lowers per capita GDP by 20 percent or more by then , unless emissions decline . By comparison , the Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent , in a onetime shock ; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse .\n\nThe scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend , but you can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an economy half as big , which would produce only half as much value , generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world . It makes the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically small economic potatoes . And , among other things , it makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business calculation .\nEvery round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London , keep in mind , costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice .\n\nVIII . Poisoned Oceans\nSulfide burps off the skeleton coast .\n\nThat the sea will become a killer is a given . Barring a radical reduction of emissions , we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century . A third of the world ’ s major cities are on the coast , not to mention its power plants , ports , navy bases , farmlands , fisheries , river deltas , marshlands , and rice-paddy empires , and even those above ten feet will flood much more easily , and much more regularly , if the water gets that high . At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today .\n\nBut the drowning of those homelands is just the start . At present , more than a third of the world ’ s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God , or else we ’ d have that much more warming already . But the result is what ’ s called “ ocean acidification , ” which , on its own , may add a half a degree to warming this century . It is also already burning through the planet ’ s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place . You have probably heard of “ coral bleaching ” — that is , coral dying — which is very bad news , because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people . Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly , too , though scientists aren ’ t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat ; they do know that in acid waters , oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells , and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans ’ pH has over the past generation , it induces seizures , comas , and sudden death .\n\nThat isn ’ t all that ocean acidification can do . Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “ anoxic , ” first in deep ocean “ dead zones , ” then gradually up toward the surface . There , the small fish die out , unable to breathe , which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive , and the feedback loop doubles back . This process , in which dead zones grow like cancers , choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries , is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia , where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “ Skeleton Coast. ” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry , but today it ’ s more apt than ever . Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the tiniest , safest traces of it , which is why our noses are so exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence . Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died , once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt — it ’ s the planet ’ s preferred gas for a natural holocaust . Gradually , the ocean ’ s dead zones spread , killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of millions of years , and the gas the inert waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land . Plants , too . It was millions of years before the oceans recovered .\n\nIX . The Great Filter\nOur present eeriness can not last .\n\nSo why can ’ t we see it ? In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement , the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven ’ t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don ’ t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe , and why we haven ’ t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “ the environmental uncanny. ” “ Consider , for example , the stories that congeal around questions like , ‘ Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell ? ’ or ‘ Where were you on 9/11 ? ’ ” he writes . “ Will it ever be possible to ask , in the same vein , ‘ Where were you at 400 ppm ? ’ or ‘ Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up ? ’ ” His answer : Probably not , because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves , especially in novels , which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate .\n\nSurely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it . In a six-degree-warmer world , the Earth ’ s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “ weather ” : a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts , the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations . The strongest hurricanes will come more often , and we ’ ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them ; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently , and hail rocks will quadruple in size . Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future ; going forward , we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past . Early naturalists talked often about “ deep time ” — the perception they had , contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin , of the profound slowness of nature . What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “ dreamtime , ” or “ everywhen ” : the semi-mythical experience , described by Aboriginal Australians , of encountering , in the present moment , an out-of-time past , when ancestors , heroes , and demigods crowded an epic stage . You can find it already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea — a feeling of history happening all at once .\n\nIt is . Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and economic debt , accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and now come due after several centuries — a helpful perspective , in a way , since it is the carbon-burning processes that began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that followed . But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades ; since the end of World War II , the figure is 85 percent . Which means that , in the length of a single generation , global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe , and that the story of the industrial world ’ s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime . My father ’ s , for instance : born in 1938 , among his first memories the news of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that followed , films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American industrial might ; and among his last memories the coverage of the desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news , ten weeks before he died of lung cancer last July . Or my mother ’ s : born in 1945 , to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives were incinerated , now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity paradise , a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized developing world . She has been smoking for 57 of those years , unfiltered .\n\nOr the scientists ’ . Some of the men who first identified a changing climate ( and given the generation , those who became famous were men ) are still alive ; a few are even still working . Wally Broecker is 84 years old and drives to work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory across the Hudson every day from the Upper West Side . Like most of those who first raised the alarm , he believes that no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster . Instead , he puts his faith in carbon capture — untested technology to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , which Broecker estimates will cost at least several trillion dollars — and various forms of “ geoengineering , ” the catchall name for a variety of moon-shot technologies far-fetched enough that many climate scientists prefer to regard them as dreams , or nightmares , from science fiction . He is especially focused on what ’ s called the aerosol approach — dispersing so much sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere that when it converts to sulfuric acid , it will cloud a fifth of the horizon and reflect back 2 percent of the sun ’ s rays , buying the planet at least a little wiggle room , heat-wise . “ Of course , that would make our sunsets very red , would bleach the sky , would make more acid rain , ” he says . “ But you have to look at the magnitude of the problem . You got to watch that you don ’ t say the giant problem shouldn ’ t be solved because the solution causes some smaller problems. ” He won ’ t be around to see that , he told me . “ But in your lifetime … ”\n\nJim Hansen is another member of this godfather generation . Born in 1941 , he became a climatologist at the University of Iowa , developed the groundbreaking “ Zero Model ” for projecting climate change , and later became the head of climate research at NASA , only to leave under pressure when , while still a federal employee , he filed a lawsuit against the federal government charging inaction on warming ( along the way he got arrested a few times for protesting , too ) . The lawsuit , which is brought by a collective called Our Children ’ s Trust and is often described as “ kids versus climate change , ” is built on an appeal to the equal-protection clause , namely , that in failing to take action on warming , the government is violating it by imposing massive costs on future generations ; it is scheduled to be heard this winter in Oregon district court . Hansen has recently given up on solving the climate problem with a carbon tax alone , which had been his preferred approach , and has set about calculating the total cost of the additional measure of extracting carbon from the atmosphere .\n\nHansen began his career studying Venus , which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas ; he switched to studying our planet by 30 , wondering why he should be squinting across the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see it all around him on the planet he was standing on . “ When we wrote our first paper on this , in 1981 , ” he told me , “ I remember saying to one of my co-authors , ‘ This is going to be very interesting . Sometime during our careers , we ’ re going to see these things beginning to happen. ’ ”\n\nSeveral of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi ’ s famous paradox , which asks , If the universe is so big , then why haven ’ t we encountered any other intelligent life in it ? The answer , they suggested , is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years , and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred . In a universe that is many billions of years old , with star systems separated as much by time as by space , civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another . Peter Ward , a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet ’ s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas , calls this the “ Great Filter ” : “ Civilizations rise , but there ’ s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly , ” he told me . “ If you look at planet Earth , the filtering we ’ ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions. ” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun ; so much more dying is coming .\n\nAnd yet , improbably , Ward is an optimist . So are Broecker and Hansen and many of the other scientists I spoke to . We have not developed much of a religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us , or give us purpose , in the face of possible annihilation . But climate scientists have a strange kind of faith : We will find a way to forestall radical warming , they say , because we must .\n\nIt is not easy to know how much to be reassured by that bleak certainty , and how much to wonder whether it is another form of delusion ; for global warming to work as parable , of course , someone needs to survive to tell the story . The scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals , by 2050 , carbon emissions from energy and industry , which are still rising , will have to fall by half each decade ; emissions from land use ( deforestation , cow farts , etc . ) will have to zero out ; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract , annually , twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet ’ s plants now do . Nevertheless , by and large , the scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans — a confidence perhaps bolstered by their appreciation for climate change , which is , after all , a human invention , too . They point to the Apollo project , the hole in the ozone we patched in the 1980s , the passing of the fear of mutually assured destruction . Now we ’ ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday , and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it , one way or another . The planet is not used to being provoked like this , and climate systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us — even those who may be watching closely — from fully imagining the damage done already to the planet . But when we do truly see the world we ’ ve made , they say , we will also find a way to make it livable . For them , the alternative is simply unimaginable .\n\n* This article appears in the July 10 , 2017 , issue of New York Magazine .\n\n* This article has been updated to provide context for the recent news reports about revisions to a satellite data set , to more accurately reflect the rate of warming during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum , to clarify a reference to Peter Brannen ’ s The Ends of the World , and to make clear that James Hansen still supports a carbon-tax based approach to emissions .", "label": [[99, 291, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1813, 1882, "False Dilemma"], [3276, 3395, "Ad Populum"], [5721, 5936, "Faulty Generalization"], [8641, 8933, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [12515, 12641, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [14659, 14705, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [19026, 19236, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [20628, 20793, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [25570, 25659, "False Causality"], [29614, 29816, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [31743, 31982, "False Causality"], [32037, 32194, "False Causality"], [32404, 32507, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [35120, 35238, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [35240, 35348, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [294, 539, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [542, 629, "Logical Fallacy"], [722, 863, "Logical Fallacy"], [955, 1326, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2101, 2372, "Ad Populum"], [2694, 3035, "Faulty Generalization"], [5347, 5495, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4882, 5076, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [5800, 5936, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [6667, 6943, "Intentional"], [7112, 7319, "Ad Populum"], [7325, 7649, "Faulty Generalization"], [9905, 10008, "Faulty Generalization"], [10509, 10682, "Faulty Generalization"], [41818, 42064, "Intentional"], [7325, 7649, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [8286, 8540, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [8936, 9015, "Logical Fallacy"], [9423, 9784, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [11012, 11134, "Ad Populum"], [11137, 11264, "Logical Fallacy"], [11967, 12119, "Faulty Generalization"], [12122, 12306, "Logical Fallacy"], [12366, 12512, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [12515, 12641, "Faulty Generalization"], [12644, 12986, "Logical Fallacy"], [13712, 13834, "False Dilemma"], [13850, 14154, "Faulty Generalization"], [14517, 14743, "Logical Fallacy"], [15922, 16098, "Faulty Generalization"], [17142, 17313, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [18350, 18645, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [20192, 20625, "Logical Fallacy"], [21762, 22050, "Ad Populum"], [22054, 22181, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [22240, 22392, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [22552, 22772, "False Causality"], [22786, 22998, "False Causality"], [23058, 23218, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [23470, 23530, "Circular Reasoning"], [23533, 23991, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [24049, 24271, "False Causality"], [24667, 24843, "Ad Populum"], [25206, 25492, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [26104, 26241, "Fallacy of Credibility"]], "source_url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-explain-what-new-york-magazine-article-on-the-uninhabitable-earth-gets-wrong-david-wallace-wells/"}
{"id": 506, "data": "Much of recent global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists to make it look more frightening , a study has found .\n\nThe peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets ( GAST ) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “ the hottest evah ” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented .\n\nWhat they found is that these readings are “ totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data . ”\n\nThat is , the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA , NOAA , and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it can not be trusted .\n\nThis chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments .\n\nThe blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler ; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer .\n\nNote how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century .\n\nAccording to meteorologist Joe D ’ Aleo , who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso , this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend :\n\n“ Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments . ”\n\n“ Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming . ”\n\n“ You would think that when you make adjustments you ’ d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling .

In fact , the magnitude of their historical data adjustments , that removed their cyclical temperature patterns , are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data .

{"id": 510, "data": "Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet .\n\nIn the most recent WHO report on air pollution , the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world , significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany , Italy , Switzerland , the UK , Japan , Austria and France .\n\nWhile France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord , America ’ s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7 , except Canada with its scant population .\n\nFollowing standard practice , the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter . These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution .\n\nAccording to the WHO , exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , heart disease , stroke and lung cancer .\n\nThe report , which analyzed the “ annual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less ( PM2.5 ) for both urban population and rural and urban population ” found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world .\n\nThe annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg/m3 , the report states . At the very low end of the spectrum , the United States has a concentration of just 8 , while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59 , India at 66 , Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127 .\n\n“ The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution , ” the WHO states .\n\nThe WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution .\n\nIn a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world , the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America , with Chicago coming in second place , Honolulu coming in fourth , and Portland , OR , coming in sixteenth . Unsurprisingly , no cities from China , Russia or India made the list at all .\n\nSimilarly , another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China , three cities from Saudi Arabia , and a whopping seven cities from India . No U.S. city made the list .\n\nA third list , ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world , placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet . The list of the most polluted cities in the world was led by two cities from China followed by two more cities from India . Two Russian cities also made the list . Again , no U.S. cities were found here .\n\nWith such relatively clean air throughout America , how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the “ biggest polluters ” in the world ?\n\nRather than follow the time-tested practice used by the World Health Organization , which measures levels of disease-causing pollutants that get into people ’ s lungs , some have played a shell game , swapping a new measure of “ pollution ” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide .\n\nThe problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is . CO2 is colorless , odorless and completely non-toxic . Plants depend on it to live and grow , and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever .\n\nGrowers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses , raising levels to three times that of the natural environment , to produce stronger , greener , healthier plants .\n\nCurrent levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet ’ s history . Without human intervention , the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million ( ppm ) in prior eras , whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm .\n\nSome experts , such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany , have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity . Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth ’ s atmosphere “ is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally . ”\n\n“ The benefits are real , whereas the costs of warming are uncertain , ” he said .\n\nWhile the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real , dangerous pollutants to a minimum , it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations , it has the cleanest air of all .", "label": [[4265, 4389, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [133, 325, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2953, 3165, "Intentional"], [3490, 3556, "Logical Fallacy"], [4079, 4261, "Ad Populum"], [3559, 3752, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1541, 1777, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2032, 2194, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2305, 2381, "Ad Hominem"], [2397, 2560, "Ad Hominem"], [2747, 2868, "Ad Hominem"], [2953, 3163, "False Dilemma"], [3336, 3451, "Ad Hominem"], [3455, 3556, "Intentional"], [3559, 3753, "Logical Fallacy"], [4753, 4848, "False Dilemma"], [189, 326, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/05/who-united-states-among-least-polluting-nations-on-the-planet/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/playing-semantics-misleading-breitbart-article-downplays-us-contribution-to-climate-change/"}
{"id": 511, "data": "CNN —\nFollowing a successful international tour and the G-7 Summit in Italy , President Trump has an opportunity to relieve our nation of the unfair and economically devastating requirements of the Paris Agreement , the United Nations climate treaty he pledged to rip up during the campaign .\n\nAnd as soon as possible , President Trump should act on – and keep – his campaign promise .\n\nThe agreement , signed by the Obama administration last year , would commit the United States to drastically reducing its carbon emissions while allowing some countries to increase theirs . This , all while doing nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures .\n\nAccording to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study , the Paris Agreement could obliterate $ 3 trillion of GDP , 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $ 7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040 . Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $ 250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs . The cement , iron and steel , and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21 % 19 % , and 11 % respectively .\n\nNot only would these unfair standards reduce American job growth and wages and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families , they would fundamentally disadvantage the United States in the global economy . The result : our economic output would lag while other countries continued to expand their GDPs .\n\nThe agreement ’ s proponents market it as a panacea for addressing the impacts of climate change , but at its core , it is about increasing government control – over the economy , the energy sector and nearly every aspect of our daily lives . It represents the exact misguided , top-down , government-knows-best approach that American voters resoundingly rejected in 2016 .\n\nWe can not pursue a path that puts American workers first if we cripple a fossil fuel energy sector that generates 82 % of the energy consumed in the United States . The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America ’ s electric power – with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available .\n\nAmerica is poised to become a net energy exporter over the next decade . We should not abandon that progress at the cost of weakening our energy renaissance and crippling economic growth .\n\nAnd let ’ s not forget the massive utility cost increases the agreement would entail . The Clean Power Plan , a major component of fulfilling the agreement , would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16 % by 2030 , according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas , the entity that operates the electric grid for much of our state .\n\nWe simply can not afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work , increases their energy costs and devastates our core industries .\n\nIn return for crippling our economy , the Paris Agreement would do next to nothing to impact global temperatures . Under the EPA ’ s own models , if all carbon emissions in America were basically eliminated , global temperatures would only decrease by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius .\n\nWhile the agreement would have a negligible impact on temperatures , America would be putting itself at a competitive disadvantage . That ’ s because while the Obama administration irresponsibly committed America to immediate , real cuts in emissions , our global economic competitors would have no such handicap . In fact , Russia is permitted to increase its emissions approximately 50 % and China and India have no meaningful cap on emissions until 2030 .\n\nThis disparity among the countries ’ pledges inflicts real losses on our economy now while our rivals continue to grow , industrialize and diversify at their own pace with no implementation costs . In the meantime , the agreement would force American taxpayers to subsidize alternative energy at the expense of clean coal , nuclear power and natural gas – energy resources that actually work for our economy and our environment .\n\nThe Paris Agreement would also handicap America in the global race for new sources of energy . Russia has committed financial and military assets to the Arctic to stake its claim to the region ’ s vast deepwater mineral , oil and gas deposits . China is also exploring and trading for Arctic oil and gas . Meanwhile , American liquefied natural gas struggles with logistical costs that weaken its competitiveness .\n\nBy allowing our rivals to increase their cooperation and strategic leverage around the world – pressuring our allies and partners , harming domestic job creators and materially reducing our prestige and influence in the process — the agreement would damage America ’ s national security as much as our economic security . The emission cuts that the US would have to make today , and the resultant costs for our own energy firms , would weaken our ability to battle our rivals on an equal footing in the drive for untapped energy sources .\n\nEfforts to unwind some of the deal ’ s more onerous regulations are welcomed , but that is not enough . Unless the US completely withdraws , the Paris Agreement will continue to cause sustained harm to our security and economy , and it keeps the door open for future administrations to use it as means to impose more costly and ineffective energy regulations .\n\nWe should not let a deal subject to the whims of future administrations or Congresses hang like a wet blanket over our economy – driving up energy prices , devastating our industrial base and bolstering our rivals .\n\nI hope President Trump will take the opportunity before him to fulfill the commitment he made and withdraw America from the Paris Agreement .", "label": [[78, 290, "Intentional"], [1177, 1391, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1868, 2031, "Logical Fallacy"], [387, 652, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [656, 914, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [917, 1039, "Ad Populum"], [2197, 2383, "False Dilemma"], [2749, 2897, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2901, 3013, "Faulty Generalization"], [4088, 4180, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4826, 5040, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1868, 2031, "False Dilemma"], [3016, 3193, "Ad Populum"], [3347, 3509, "Intentional"], [3873, 4084, "Faulty Generalization"], [5148, 5402, "Faulty Generalization"], [5406, 5619, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [77, 214, "Ad Hominem"], [1394, 1490, "False Dilemma"], [1493, 1734, "Faulty Generalization"], [2901, 3013, "Logical Fallacy"], [3513, 3654, "Ad Hominem"], [3872, 4011, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1736, 1865, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4504, 4823, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/29/opinions/withdraw-paris-accord-opinion-cruz/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/paris-agreement-op-ed-us-senator-ted-cruz-misrepresents-costs-benefits-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions/"}
{"id": 512, "data": "THE ACCELERATION is making some scientists fear that Antarctica ’ s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration .\n\nBecause the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically , the continued existence of the world ’ s great coastal cities — Miami , New York , Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica ’ s fate .\n\nFour New York Times journalists joined a Columbia University team in Antarctica late last year to fly across the world ’ s largest chunk of floating ice in an American military cargo plane loaded with the latest scientific gear .\n\nInside the cargo hold , an engineer with a shock of white hair directed younger scientists as they threw switches . Gravity meters jumped to life . Radar pulses and laser beams fired toward the ice below .\n\nOn computer screens inside the plane , in ghostly traces of data , the broad white surface of the Ross Ice Shelf began to yield the secrets hiding beneath .\n\n“ We are 9,000 miles from New York , ” said the white-haired engineer , Nicholas Frearson of Columbia . “ But we are connected by the ocean . ”\n\nA rapid disintegration of Antarctica might , in the worst case , cause the sea to rise so fast that tens of millions of coastal refugees would have to flee inland , potentially straining societies to the breaking point . Climate scientists used to regard that scenario as fit only for Hollywood disaster scripts . But these days , they can not rule it out with any great confidence .\n\nYet as they try to determine how serious the situation is , the scientists confront a frustrating lack of information .\n\nRecent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level , parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly , causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century . That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago .\n\nBut those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them . “ We could be decades too fast , or decades too slow , ” said one of them , Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts , Amherst . “ There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica . ”\n\nAlarmed by the warning signs that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are becoming unstable , American and British scientific agencies are joining forces to get better measurements in the main trouble spots . The effort could cost more than $ 25 million and might not produce clearer answers about the fate of the ice until the early 2020s .\n\nFor scientists working in Antarctica , the situation has become a race against time .\n\nEven as the threat from global warming comes into sharper focus , these scientists understand that political leaders — and cities already feeling the effects of a rising sea — need clearer forecasts about the consequences of emissions . That urgent need for insight has led scientists from Columbia to spend the past two Antarctic summers flying over the Ross Ice Shelf , a floating chunk of ice larger than California .\n\nThe Ross shelf helps to slow the flow of land ice from Antarctica into the ocean . Compared with other parts of Antarctica , the shelf seems stable now , but computer forecasts suggest that it might be vulnerable to rapid collapse in the next few decades .\n\nThe project to map the structure and depth of the ice shelf in detail , funded by American taxpayers through the National Science Foundation , puts Columbia and its partner institutions on the front lines of one of the world ’ s most urgent scientific and political problems .\n\n“ Our goal is to understand how to predict what ’ s going to happen to the ice sheets , ” said Robin E. Bell , the lead Columbia scientist in charge of the effort . “ We really don ’ t know right now . ”\n\nRemote as Antarctica may seem , every person in the world who gets into a car , eats a steak or boards an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk . If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough , scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea .\n\nBut they do not know exactly what the trigger temperature might be , or whether the recent acceleration of the ice means that Earth has already reached it . The question confronting society , said Richard B . Alley , a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University , is easier to ask than to answer :\n\n“ How hot is too hot ? ”\n\nIn the immersive video below , a military cargo plane flies over the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf .

{"id": 516, "data": "Eight countries control land in the Arctic Circle . Five have coastlines to defend . The temperature is rising . The ice is melting . The race for newly accessible resources is beginning . And Russia is gaining ground .\nThe story of the Arctic begins with temperature but it ’ s so much more—this is a tale about oil and economics , about humanity and science , about politics and borders and the emerging risk of an emboldened and growing Russian empire .\n\nThe world as a whole has warmed about 0.9 degrees Celsius ( 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) since 1880 . Arctic temperatures have risen twice that amount during the same time period . The most recent year analyzed , October 2015 to September 2016 , was 3.5C warmer than the early 1900s , according to the 2016 Arctic Report Card . Northern Canada , Svalbard , Norway and Russia ’ s Kara Sea reached an astounding 14C ( 25F ) higher than normal last fall .\n\nScientists refer to these dramatic physical changes as “ Arctic amplification , ” or positive feedback loops . It ’ s a little bit like compound interest . A small change snowballs , and Arctic conditions become much less Arctic , much more quickly .\n\n“ After studying the Arctic and its climate for three-and-a-half decades , ” Mark Serreze , director of the National Snow and Ice Data center , wrote recently . “ I have concluded that what has happened over the last year goes beyond even the extreme . ”\n\nThe heat is making quick work of its natural prey : ice .\n\nScientists track the number of “ freezing-degree days , ” a running seasonal tally of the amount of time it ’ s been cold enough for water to freeze . The 2016-2017 winter season has seen a dramatic shortfall in coldness—more than 20 percent below the average , a record .\n\nSea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated . Last month set a new low for March , out-melting 2015 by 23,000 square miles .\n\nCompared with the 1981-2010 baseline , the average September sea-ice minimum has been dropping by more than 13 percent per decade . A recent study in Nature Climate Change estimated that from 30-50 percent of sea ice loss is due to climate variability , while the rest occurs because of human activity .\n\nReceding ice decreases the Earth ’ s overall reflectivity , making the Arctic darker and therefore absorbing even more heat .\n\nThe ice is not all the same age or thickness , although it has become somewhat more uniform . In 1985 , about 45 percent of Arctic sea ice was made up of older and thicker multi-year ice . By 2016 , that number shrank to 22 percent .\n\nWith a greater percentage of seasonal ice , which disappears each Arctic summer , nations of the north have more time and opportunity to explore the resources beneath and within their territorial waters .\n\nThe sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin ’ s gain . Already the largest country on the planet , Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves , and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic .\n\nAlong the Russian coastline , which makes up more than half the Arctic total , winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker , multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods . That dynamic helps bring the Northern Sea Route—shippers ’ hoped-for Russian express between Western Europe and East Asia—closer to fruition .\n\nSea ice , by definition , is already in the water and therefore does n't add to rising ocean levels as it dissolves . The same logic does not apply to Greenland ’ s melting glaciers and ice sheets . Last year , Greenland saw the second-largest melt on record . The hot season lasted a troubling 30 to 40 days longer than usual in the northeast portion of the region .\n\nThere 's enough water locked up in Greenland ’ s ice sheet to raise seas worldwide by 20 feet . While it may take centuries to fully melt , scientists are concerned that we have a limited time to act to prevent the climate from locking in the ice sheet ’ s demise .\n\nLife in the Arctic is changing along with the climate . “ Green ice ” has appeared in recent years . Named for its distinctive hue , this ice is so thin that sunlight shines through , allowing phytoplankton to thrive . Vegetation growth in parts of Canadian and Russian Arctic waters has boomed to from 5 and 19 percent above the 2003-2015 average , according to NOAA . What the change means for delicate ecosystems and fish stocks is the subject of increasing research attention .\n\nIn a presentation in November , Johan Rockström , environmental scientist and director of the Stockholm Resilience Center , reached for scientific euphemism to make manageable the enormous scale of these interlocking changes—and who needs to be thinking about them : “ Canada , Russia and parts of the U.S. seem to be the Arctic nations subject to the largest , let ’ s say , set of diverse regime-shift risks . ''\n\nIn the long run , every part of the Arctic food web may have to adjust to the warming atmosphere ’ s byproduct : altered ocean chemistry .\n\nOceans do humanity a huge favor by absorbing some atmospheric carbon dioxide . However , when CO2 dissolves into water , it becomes a weak acid that , as it accumulates , may strain ecosystems that have evolved for today ’ s slightly alkaline waters . The change is happening globally , but cold water “ acidifies ” more quickly than warmer seas .\n\nArctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere . While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible , depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer , scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in .\n\nPerhaps the most visually dramatic change in the landscape has been occurring in Russia . Warming temperatures have accelerated the rate of natural underground methane leaks . The gas builds up in the soil , forming mounds called “ pingoes. ” When the pressure becomes too great , the ground explodes , leaving 30 to 40-meter-wide craters .\n\nSeismologists have begun to install sensors in the Russian Arctic to give advance notice of fields ready to blow their top . These local events are a powerful visual example of how the world is changing in dramatic and surprising ways .\n\nMany scientists who study the Arctic say that there ’ s simply no way such dramatic change at the top of the world can avoid affecting life below it . There ’ s already a cliche : What happens in the Arctic doesn ’ t stay in the Arctic .", "label": [[0, 217, "Logical Fallacy"], [2786, 3021, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [6118, 6352, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-arctic/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bloomberg-accurately-describes-rapidly-changing-arctic-eric-roston-blacki-migliozzi/"}
{"id": 517, "data": "Reporting from Soda Springs , Calif. — California ’ s climate has long been dominated by cycles of intense dry conditions followed by heavy rain and snow .\nBut never before in recorded history has the state seen such an extreme drought-to-deluge swing .\n\nExperts and state water officials say California is seeing more of these intense weather swings as temperatures warm , which has profound implications for the droughts and floods the state may face in the generations to come .\n\nBy Wednesday or Thursday , a new series of late-season storms is expected to vault this winter into the history books , making this year the wettest winter for California ’ s northern Sierra Nevada in nearly a century of record-keeping . This is significant because the mountain range supplies large amounts of water for the rest of the state .\n\nThe expected milestone is all the more remarkable given that just two years before , the state was experiencing record dry conditions .\n\n“ We went from a driest-on-record scenario to a wettest-on-record scenario , ” said David Rizzardo , chief of the snow survey section at the California Department of Water Resources .\n\nDrought-to-deluge cycle\nThe extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades .\n\n“ When you look at the other five wettest years other than this one , the earliest of those is 1982 , ” Rizzardo said . “ When you look at the snowpack , the three driest years on record are 2015 , 1991 , and 1977 . ”\n\nThe shift has coincided with increases in California temperatures that scientists say began about 1980 .\n\n“ The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter , ” said Jeffrey Mount , a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California . “ That is consistent with what the climate simulations are suggesting would be a consequence for California under a warming planet . ”\n\nWarming global temperatures can have a profound effect on weather patterns across the planet . Changing the distribution of warmth in the ocean drives changes in the atmosphere , which ultimately decides how much precipitation gets to California , Mount said .\n\nWarm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought , which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation . California ’ s first- , second- and third-hottest years on record , in terms of statewide average temperatures , were 2014 , 2015 and 2016 . And it ’ s no coincidence that California ’ s extreme water supply woes coincided with hot weather .\n\nWarm temperatures in 2015 made the precipitation that did fall drop as rain instead of snow . Some rain that fell in the early part of that winter had to be flushed out to sea to keep space available in reservoirs just in case flooding came later . By spring 2015 , the Sierra and Cascades produced a dubious historical record — the smallest snowpack on record , just 5 % of average .\n\nAnd this winter ’ s near disaster at the overflowing Lake Oroville was in part caused by warm storms too . Exceptional water flows into the state ’ s second-largest reservoir came not only from a constant stream of “ atmospheric river ” storms that happened to strike California but also because so much precipitation was coming down as warmer rain . Colder snow would not have posed an immediate flood risk .\n\nCalifornia water officials have been discussing how warming will affect the state ’ s water system . Now some officials believe they will have to change the infrastructure — such as building or raising dams and constructing two giant tunnels underneath the confluence of the state ’ s two largest rivers — to deal with more precipitation falling as rain and snow melting more quickly .\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge .\n\nAfter all , humans have only been recording rainfall and the snowpack for a relatively short period of time in California . “ I think the evidence is not very conclusive . But this surely bears watching over the coming years , ” said Dan Cayan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego .\n\n“ Whether this is occurring because of climate change or because we ’ re unlucky kind of doesn ’ t matter , because we have to deal with it either way , ” said Jay Lund , director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis .\n\nIn Sierras , a winter that won ’ t end\nTwo years ago , the lack of snow left locals in Soda Springs and many other parts of the Sierra stunned and anxious .\n\nThe drought hurt ski resorts and changed the landscape of the Sierras . In some areas , trees died at an alarming rate . In others , the typically snow-capped mountains were bare and dry .\n\nThis winter , however , many residents say they ’ ve never seen so much snow .\n\nAs of Tuesday , an astonishing 87.7 inches of precipitation across a zone of eight stations in the northern Sierra has been recorded since October . That ’ s just shy of the 88.5 inches recorded by the conclusion of the 1982-83 rain year .\n\n“ There ’ s just been too many road closures , too many power outages , and just too much snow and nowhere to put it , ” said Janet Tuttle , who with her husband owns Donner Ski Ranch , one of the oldest ski resorts in the state . She had a better season financially in the very ordinary weather of last year .\n\nKelley Bernard , 37 , didn ’ t spend the winter here by choice . She was reassigned by the U.S . Postal Service a year and a half ago to singlehandedly staff the Soda Springs-Norden office where some 500 mountaintop residents collect their mail .\n\nShe has made the 30-mile , 4,300-foot ascent from snow-less Colfax every day in a family van , even those days when Interstate 80 was closed by blinding storms . The first time she put on her new tire chains , it took her 45 minutes to finish one tire , “ and I cried , calling my supervisor , saying , ‘ I can ’ t do this ! ’ ”\n\nMore than 750 inches of snow later , Bernard has not missed a single day . She has videos of herself sitting in terror in the minivan , stuck in a white-out with snow up to the axles . She can slap chains on both wheels now in less than seven minutes .\n\n“ So it ’ s been a blessing , ” she said from behind the mail counter . “ I never thought I could be this tough . ”\n\nMore water — until the next dry spell\nThe intense winter prompted Gov . Jerry Brown last week to finally declare the drought over in all counties except Fresno , Kings , Tulare and Tuolumne , where diminished groundwater levels still require a need for emergency drinking water . But right now , the above-ground water supply is much improved for most parts of the state .\n\nMany of California ’ s reservoirs are healthy and full . Lake Shasta , California ’ s largest reservoir , is 93 % full . San Luis Reservoir , an important holding area for water that will later be sent to Southern California , is at 98 % of capacity .\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is hoping to add 1 million acre-feet of water to its so-called dry-year storage . That would get its total storage up to 2.3 million acre-feet , which would almost get the district ’ s storage up to its high point in 2012 , said Demetri Polyzos , senior water resource management engineer for the MWD .\n\nThat would last a few years if consecutive dry years return to California .\n\nThe next drought , officials say , could be just around the corner .", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-record-rains-20170410-story.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/climate-context-for-a-wet-winter-in-drought-stricken-california-in-the-la-times-rong-gong-lin-ii-paige-st-john-los-angeles-times/"}
{"id": 518, "data": "Just down the coast from Donald Trump 's weekend retreat , the residents and businesses of south Florida are experiencing regular episodes of water in the streets . In the battle against rising seas , the region – which has more to lose than almost anywhere else in the world – is becoming ground zero .\n\nBBC Future has brought you in-depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current pandemic , but we know that ’ s not all you want to read . So now we ’ re dedicating a series to help you escape . We ’ ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads .\n\nYou ’ ll find everything from the story about the world ’ s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us , the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life . What you won ’ t find is any reference to , well , you-know-what . Enjoy .\n\nThe first time my father ’ s basement flooded , it was shortly after he moved in . The building was an ocean-front high-rise in a small city north of Miami called Sunny Isles Beach . The marble lobby had a waterfall that never stopped running ; crisp-shirted valets parked your car for you . For the residents who lived in the more lavish flats , these cars were often BMWs and Mercedes . But no matter their value , the cars all wound up in the same place : the basement .\n\nWhen I called , I ’ d ask my dad how the building was doing . “ The basement flooded again a couple weeks ago , ” he ’ d sometimes say . Or : “ It ’ s getting worse. ” It ’ s not only his building : he ’ s also driven through a foot of water on a main road a couple of towns over and is used to tiptoeing around pools in the local supermarket ’ s car park .\n\nAsk nearly anyone in the Miami area about flooding and they ’ ll have an anecdote to share . Many will also tell you that it ’ s happening more and more frequently . The data backs them up .\n\nIt ’ s easy to think that the only communities suffering from sea level rise are far-flung and remote . And while places like the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are indeed facing particularly dramatic challenges , they aren ’ t the only ones being forced to grapple with the issue . Sea levels are rising around the world , and in the US , south Florida is ground zero – as much for the adaptation strategies it is attempting as for the risk that it bears .\n\nOne reason is that water levels here are rising especially quickly . The most frequently-used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15-25cm ( 6-10in ) above 1992 levels by 2030 , and 79-155cm ( 31-61in ) by 2100 . With tides higher than they have been in decades – and far higher than when this swampy , tropical corner of the US began to be drained and built on a century ago – many of south Florida ’ s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough . That means not only more flooding , but challenges for the infrastructure that residents depend on every day , from septic tanks to wells . “ The consequences of sea level rise are going to occur way before the high tide reaches your doorstep , ” says William Sweet , an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .\n\nThe flooding would be a challenge for any community , but it poses particular risks here . One recent report estimated that Miami has the most to lose in terms of financial assets of any coastal city in the world , just above Guangzhou , China and New York City . This 120-mile ( 193km ) corridor running up the coast from Homestead to Jupiter – taking in major cities like Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach – is the eighth most populous metropolitan area in the US . It ’ s also booming . In 2015 , the US Census Bureau found that the population of all three counties here was growing – along with the rest of Florida – at around 8 % , roughly twice the pace of the US average . Recent studies have shown that Florida has more residents at risk from climate change than any other US state .\n\nIt has more property at risk , too . In Miami-Dade County , developers had 1.6 million sq ft ( 149,000 sq m ) of office space and 1.8 million of retail space under construction in the second quarter of 2016 alone . Sunny Isles Beach , home to 20,300 people , has eight high-rise buildings under construction ; swing a seagull in the air , and you ’ ll hit a crane . As you might imagine , the value of development in this sun-soaked part of the country is high , too . Property in Sunny Isles alone is now worth more than $ 10 billion . Many of the wealthiest people in the US reside in Florida , including 40 billionaires on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans ; on a recent week , the most expensive real estate listing in the US was a $ 54 million mansion in Palm Beach .\n\nDespite his history of referring to climate change as a “ hoax ” and his recent rollback of emissions-slashing initiatives , President Donald Trump is one of these property owners with a stake in the issue . The president frequently visits his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach , 75 miles ( 121km ) north of Miami , which is itself an area experiencing flooding from high tides . There also are six Trump-branded residential buildings in Sunny Isles , one of which still provides the president with income , and a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood .\n\nLook beyond all the glass and steel , though , and – despite the federal government ’ s sidelining of the issue – there ’ s another thrum of activity . It ’ s the wastewater treatment plant constructing new buildings five feet higher than the old ones . The 105 miles ( 169km ) of roads being raised in Miami Beach . The new shopping mall built with flood gates . The 116 tidal valves installed in Fort Lauderdale . The seawalls being raised and repaired . And the worried conversations between more and more residents every year about what the sea-rise models predict – and what to do about it .\n\nThe communities aren ’ t short of solutions . “ Nobody ’ s doing better adaptation work in the country than south Florida , ” says Daniel Kreeger , executive director of the nonprofit Association of Climate Change Officers . But the question isn ’ t whether this work will save every community : it won ’ t . Even those tasked with making their cities resilient admit that , at some point in the future , certain areas here will no longer be “ viable ” places to live . Rather , the challenge is to do enough to ensure that the economy as a whole continues to thrive and that tourists still come to enjoy the sun , sand – and swelling sea .\n\nIt ’ s a challenge that many officials and experts are determined to meet . Getting there , though , requires a shift in how everyone from mayors to taxpayers , insurers to engineers , property developers to urban planners thinks about their communities – and the everyday decisions that shape them . The eyes of the world are on them : if one of the richest communities on the planet can ’ t step up , what hope is there for everyone else ?\n\n“ If the science is correct on this – which it is going to be – the question is , ‘ How extreme are the implications ? ’ ” says Kreeger . “ We are literally going to have to rewrite how businesses function , and how cities are designed . Everything ’ s going to change . And that ’ s particularly going to be exacerbated in coastal communities .\n\n“ This would be no different than if I came to you and said ‘ Hey , in 40 years , gravity ’ s going to change . I can ’ t tell you exactly what it ’ s going to be . But let ’ s assume roughly between 50 % and 80 % stronger or weaker than it is now. ’ You ’ d look around and say ‘ Shoot , what ’ s that going to affect ? ’\n\n`` And the answer is : it affects everything . ”\n\n*\nSea level rise is global . But due to a variety of factors – including , for this part of the Atlantic coast , a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream , itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland ’ s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others . While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s , in the last decade , the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually .\n\nThat may not sound like much . But as an average , it doesn ’ t tell the whole story of what residents see – including more extreme events like king tides ( extremely high tides ) , which have been getting dramatically higher . What ’ s more , when you ’ re talking about places like Miami Beach – where , as chief resiliency officer Susanne Torriente jokes , the elevation ranges between “ flat and flatter ” – every millimetre counts . Most of Miami Beach ’ s built environment sits at an elevation of 60-120cm ( 2-6ft ) . And across the region , underground infrastructure – like aquifers or septic tanks – lies even closer to the water table .\n\nOn a nearly two-hour tour of Fort Lauderdale ’ s adaptation strategies , the city ’ s head of sustainability , Nancy Gassman , points out incremental differences in elevation : slight rolls in the sidewalk or paving that usually go unnoticed . “ That might seem weird that I ’ m pointing out a couple of feet difference , ” she says . “ But a couple feet in south Florida – it ’ s time . Elevation is time for us . ”\n\nNot only are sea levels rising , but the pace seems to be accelerating . That ’ s been noted before – but what it means for south Florida was only recently brought home in a University of Miami study . “ After 2006 , sea level rose faster than before – and much faster than the global rate , ” says the lead author Shimon Wdowinski , who is now with Miami ’ s Florida International University . From 3mm per year from 1998 to 2005 , the rise off Miami Beach tripled to that 9mm rate from 2006 .\n\nAn uptick also happened between the 1930s and 1950s , says Wdowinski , making some question whether this is a similar oscillation . But that ’ s probably wishful thinking . “ It ’ s not necessarily what we see now . This warming of the planet has been growing for a while , ” he says . “ It ’ s probably a different process than what happened 60 years ago . ”\n\n“ Can we definitely say it ’ s the ocean warming ? ” says Sweet , who has authored several sea-level rise studies . “ No . But is it indicative of what we ’ d expect to see ? Yes . ”\n\nModelling specific future scenarios is difficult – partly because scientists are still collecting and analysing data , partly because there are so many variables . What if the US or China reverses its trend on stabilising emissions ? What if a major volcano erupts ? What if a glacier melts more quickly than expected ? But enough credible projections have been done to put together a range of scenarios that researchers are confident about .\n\nOne graph compiled in 2015 by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact , a non-partisan initiative that collates expertise and coordinates efforts across Broward , Miami-Dade , Monroe and Palm Beach counties , is especially revealing ( see below ) . At the bottom is a dotted green line , which rises slowly . Before you get optimistic , the footnote is firm : “ This scenario would require significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in order to be plausible and does not reflect current emissions trends. ” More probable is the range in the middle , shaded blue , which shows that a 6-10in ( 15-25cm ) rise above 1992 levels is likely by 2030 . At the top , the orange line is more severe still , going off the chart – to 81 inches ( 206cm ) – by the end of the century .\n\nBut as more data comes in , even the worst-case estimates may turn out to be too low : for example , researchers recently discovered that ice is melting more rapidly than expected from both Antarctica and Greenland , plus gained a better understanding of how melting ice sheets actually affect sea-level rise . “ The unlikely scenarios are now , all of a sudden , becoming more probable than they once were thought to be , ” says Sweet .\n\nThe most dramatic impacts may not be felt for 50 or 100 years . But coastal communities are already experiencing more storms and extremely high tides known as king tides . In the same study , Wdowinski found there were a total of 16 flood events in Miami Beach from 1998 to 2005 . From 2006 to 2013 , there were 33 .\n\nAlthough the timing of king tides results from the positions of the Sun , Moon and Earth , rising seas heighten their effect . At extreme high tides , water levels have surged to an inch below the Intracoastal Waterway , says Jennifer Jurado , Broward County ’ s chief resiliency officer . “ Once that ’ s breached , you ’ re open to the ocean – the supply of water is endless . The system is really at capacity . These are flood conditions , even with just the high tide and supermoon… You see men in business suits trying to trudge through water . ”\n\nEven without floods , the rising water table affects everything . The cities here are built on porous limestone . The water doesn ’ t just come over seawalls ; it seeps up from beneath the streets . Nearly 90 % of the drinking water in south Florida comes from aquifers , and these are finding their fresh water pushed further and further inland as the salt water exerts more and more pressure . Take Hallandale Beach , a small city of just under 40,000 residents . Saltwater already has breached five of the eight freshwater wells that the city draws from , says Vice Mayor Keith London . And around a quarter of Miami-Dade residents use septic tanks . If these don ’ t remain above the water table , the result could be thoroughly unpleasant .\n\nAnother issue is beach erosion . Florida ’ s sand may be one of its biggest draws for tourist dollars , but it , too , is vulnerable : though sand never stays put , rising sea levels and worsening storms mean the need to replenish is intensifying . A massive town-by-town project is currently underway ; Miami Beach ( which , famously , was manmade from the start ) just wrapped up its 3,000ft ( 914m ) section , to the tune of $ 11.9 million .\n\nOf course , another part of the problem is that south Florida is built on a swamp . “ The only reason we live here is we learned how to drain it , we learned how to kill mosquitos , and we created air conditioning , ” says Jim Murley , chief resilience officer for Miami-Dade County . Residents cut canals to drain inland areas , using the fill to raise the land and build properties . These canals are now open doors for tidal flooding and storm surge . They also cut down mangrove forests and levelled sand dunes – both natural barriers to flooding .\n\n“ There is going to need to be a very serious conversation about how we deal with this , ” says George Vallejo , the mayor of North Miami Beach . “ The development that has happened here over the last 40 or 50 years has not been helpful to this situation . We ’ ve paved over a lot of the Everglades , we ’ ve paved over a lot of greenage .\n\n“ We ’ ve done a lot of things that , in retrospect , we would have done differently , knowing what we know now . ”\n\n*\n\nThat ’ s the bad news . But there ’ s good news , says Gassman , whose no-nonsense demeanour and doctorate in marine biology ( with a focus on coastal ecosystems ) makes her particularly convincing . “ That ’ s all if nothing changes . I think that ’ s another thing that the public doesn ’ t necessarily understand : the predictions that they ’ re hearing , time and time again , are if we do nothing . But we ’ re not doing nothing . ”\n\nThat ’ s point one . Point two is that the topography of the area isn ’ t quite what you ’ d expect . She brings out a map of Fort Lauderdale dotted with squares of purple and orange . Purple means an area is likely to be underwater at 2ft ( 61cm ) of sea level rise ; orange means it ’ s possible . A surprisingly small amount of the map is splashed with colour . And the at-risk areas – which are mostly by the bay , not the ocean – aren ’ t where you might think . “ It ’ s not the whole city , ” she says . “ While there are problems in some areas , we ’ ll have to adjust , but these areas are not in places you ’ d expect – and we ’ ll have time to address some of these issues . ”\n\nNot every community might be so lucky . Play the inundation game with Noaa ’ s perversely addictive mapping tool in Hollywood , just 10 miles ( 16km ) south of Fort Lauderdale , and you ’ ll find that the same 2ft ( 61cm ) rise could put streets and most properties of an entire square-mile swathe underwater – not insignificant for a city measuring just 30 sq miles ( 78 sq km ) . ( Hollywood also has its own intervention programme underway , including the installation of 18 flap gates to keep seawater from coming up through the drainage system ) . Still , it ’ s a good reminder that the problem , as overwhelming as it seems , can be broken down into smaller pieces .\n\nWhich is exactly what Gassman and others are trying to do . Touring the city with Gassman is to see it in an entirely new way : not just a city of graceful mansions and pretty canals , but of seawalls that are leaking or too short , fire hydrants that are made of iron ( “ a fundamental , emergency-based infrastructure that ’ s made out of a material that ’ s potentially corrosive from saltwater ” ) , drains that are overflowing and electrical boxes that need to be raised .\n\n“ See , those cars are disappearing from view , ” she says , pointing to the dip in the road in front of us . We turn onto Isle of Capri Drive . “ Look what ’ s happening . Look how far I ’ m going to go down . This area floods all the time . ”\n\nFort Lauderdale is dubbed the Venice of America . That ’ s supposed to be because of its 165 miles ( 266km ) of canals , but recent flooding has made the nickname more on the nose than residents would like .\n\nFor both Fort Lauderdale and other communities across south Florida , the main problem is drainage . The systems here were designed to let stormwater drain into the ocean when it rains . Because homes and gardens are higher than the crown of the road , the streets flood first in a storm , by design . Water runs into the storm drain and is piped into the ocean or waterways that lead there .\n\nAt least , that ’ s what is supposed to happen . With sea levels now often higher than the exits to the run-off pipes , saltwater is instead running up through the system and into the streets . To make matters worse , when the sea gets even higher , it can breach the seawall , flood people ’ s yards and flow down to the road – where it stays .\n\nSince 2013 , Fort Lauderdale has been installing tidal valves to deal with the problem . Each of the one-way valves , which allows stormwater through but not saltwater , looks like a big rubber tube and can be attached inside the storm drains . Gassman pulls one out to show me . “ If you stick your hand in there and push a little bit , see how it opens ? ” I do . “ Right there , you were fresh water . Now you ’ re about to be salt water. ” She flips the valve around . I push : sure enough , it ’ s a no-go .\n\nIn some areas , the valves alone have been enough . But there ’ s a catch : the floodwater still can ’ t leave if the tide is above the level of the outflow pipes . That happened early on at one of the first places they installed a valve , Gassman says . A king tide came over the tops of the seawalls , flooded the street – and then remained higher than the outfall . “ The valve wouldn ’ t open . So the roads stayed flooded 24/7 , ” she says . “ We have had complaints that the valves aren ’ t working . But no . The valves are working . ”\n\nDespite the limitations of the valves , it doesn ’ t take an engineer to figure out that raising seawalls would fix flooding that resulted from high sea levels , if not from rain . But until recently , Fort Lauderdale had a height requirement for seawalls that was a maximum , not a minimum – for aesthetic reasons . Though some now do specify a minimum height , enforcement remains difficult . A new seawall runs from $ 600 to $ 2,000 for a linear foot ; adding a 12in ( 30cm ) cap costs about $ 60 per foot . For the average homeowner , a seawall measures 75-100ft ( 23-30m ) . “ How are you going to force everyone to put in money ? ” asks Gassman .\n\nIt turns out you can ’ t , at least for now . Last year , Fort Lauderdale proposed that everyone should be made to raise their seawalls to a certain height by 2035 . Thanks to opposition from the public , the proposal failed . Instead , property owners are required to keep their seawalls in a state of good repair . Someone can be reported to the authorities if their seawall is breached by the tide , but the specific new height requirement only kicks in if someone came to ask for the permit – which is required to do significant repairs , or to build a new wall . And Fort Lauderdale makes an interesting test case : if costs seem prohibitive in this relatively well-off area , it ’ s not going to work in south Florida ’ s less affluent communities – some of which also are suffering from similar flooding .\n\nDespite Fort Lauderdale ’ s best efforts , seawalls here remain a patchwork of heights and states of repair . At Cordova Road , Gassman and I look over the finger isles pointing into the Stranahan River . Across the road from the marina , one house has bright-green grass : it ’ s new , put down after a flood last spring swamped their property with salt water .\n\nGassman points to an older house on the corner . Their seawall is about a foot lower than their neighbour ’ s . “ That foot of difference allows water to run over their property and flood the road , ” she says . “ That one property , if we could fix that seawall , we could reduce a lot of flooding , right here . ”\n\nIt ’ s not just residents who need to make changes . The city also owns a seawall along this stretch ; it , too , was breached recently . Replacing the nearly half-mile stretch could cost up to $ 5 million . But getting the funds is just the first challenge . The end of the seawall meets a bridge . If you raise the seawall two more feet , what do you do with that bridge to protect it ? And what about the docks that residents are currently allowed to have here , all of which will have to be re-done ? “ The people that live here want a solution and they want it now , ” says Gassman . “ But there ’ s both a public and a private cost . And changing one piece of infrastructure starts to domino into needing to change all sorts of things . ”\n\nAs well as seawalls , cities are investing in pumps . Many have put pump stations in the worst-hit neighbourhoods . But only Miami Beach has adopted an integrated , major pumping system as part of an aggressive overall defence strategy . Starting in 2013 , the programme – which Torriente estimates will cost between $ 400 and $ 500 million – is multi-pronged . Pump stations have sprouted across Sunset Harbour , an industrial-turned-hip neighbourhood on the barrier island ’ s bay side , and are moving south .\n\nRoads are being raised , too , sometimes by up to 2ft ( 61cm ) , to an elevation which the Southeast Florida Climate Compact ’ s projections put as a likely sea level height around 2065 . Seawalls are being raised to a new minimum – something that residents in Miami Beach were more amenable to than in Fort Lauderdale . The city also is requiring that all new properties build their first floor higher .\n\nIt ’ s an ambitious agenda . And it ’ s one that ’ s working . Areas where roads have been raised and pumps installed have been much drier . But , as Gassman noted , it ’ s not enough to change one piece of infrastructure without changing everything else . In this case , what happens when you raise a road without raising all of the properties around it ? Water can go into the properties .\n\nThat ’ s not supposed to happen when the pumps work . But they can fail . Antonio Gallo ’ s Sardinia Enoteca Ristorante is one of a number of businesses that have found their ground floors are now below the current road and sidewalk height . Last year , the pumps failed to kick in after a brief period of rain ; the restaurant flooded , with diners stuck inside . When Gallo went to file his insurance claim , it was turned down . According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) , which runs a national flood insurance programme for at-risk business and property owners like Gallo , anything below street level is considered a basement . Until Fema changes their policy , that includes all of the businesses now below the raised streets . Miami Beach is working closely with Fema to get not only Gallo ’ s situation , but the general basement classification , re-assessed .\n\nMiami Beach ’ s efforts are the most aggressive . But resilience also can be built into existing projects . A lot of public infrastructure is built to last for at least 50 or 75 years , and that means planning for what the world will look like then . This is where the Compact ’ s range of scenarios comes in handy . If you ’ re laying down something easily replaceable , like a sidewalk , you could build for one of the more optimistic scenarios . An airport ? It ’ s a good idea to go for a higher-risk scenario .\n\nMurley , the chief resilience officer of Miami-Dade County ( the county 's first ) , points to a 4,200ft-long ( 1280m ) tunnel that runs from the Port of Miami to highway I395 . Opened in 2014 , its main objective was to re-route lorries that previously went through downtown Miami . But the tunnel was also given a huge gate that , in a hurricane , drops down to seal it at both ends . “ That ’ s an example of resilience . We wouldn ’ t have built that 10 years ago , ” says Murley . “ We would have built the tunnel , but it would have had an open front . We might have had sand bags . ”\n\nA larger-scale example of built-in resilience is going on at the Central District Wastewater and Treatment Plant on Virginia Key , a barrier island where Biscayne Bay and the ocean meet , just east of downtown Miami . It is one of three wastewater treatment plants run by the largest utility in Florida , which serves 2.3 million of the county ’ s 2.6 million residents . Like the other two , it sits right by the water .\n\nThe plant already had a $ 500 million project on the go , making changes to comply with new Clean Water Act requirements . But because parts of the facility are expected to last 75 years or more , resilience to higher sea levels and storm surge has been baked into the design . Analysts ran what would be needed in a worst-case scenario : a category five hurricane during a king tide , with maximum rainfall . “ What the results told us was that we ought to be building stuff at 17-20ft ( 5-6m ) above sea level on the coast . Our current facilities , by and large , range from 10-15ft ( 3-4.5m ) , ” says Doug Yoder , deputy director of Miami-Dade ’ s water and sewer department . The new design standards prioritise building at those elevations first for parts of the plants that convey flow – like the electrical wiring and pumps . “ At least we won ’ t have raw sewage flooding the streets , ” says Yoder .\n\nPrivate developers will need to think about these issues , too . According to the non-partisan research organisation Risky Business , current projections put between $ 15 billion and $ 23 billion of existing Florida property underwater by 2050 . By the end of the century , that leaps to between $ 53 and $ 208 billion .\n\nBut many developers aren ’ t thinking to 2050 or 2100 . Their focus is on the time from construction to sale . In a hot real estate market like south Florida , where a lot of investors are foreign or periodic visitors , that timeframe is far shorter – a few years at most .\n\nUntil regulations enforce common building standards , few private developers are likely to adopt resilient designs . “ I think it ’ s very hard for a developer or builder to do something the code or government doesn ’ t require in their zoning or building code , ” says Wayne Pathman , a Miami-based land use and zoning attorney and the chairman of the new City of Miami Sea Level Rise committee .\n\nOne exception is Brickell City Centre , a $ 1 billion , 9-acre complex of stores , restaurants , offices , condominiums and hotel in Brickell , a corner of downtown Miami filled with cranes and skyscrapers . Developed by Hong Kong-based Swire Properties , the complex is sleek and airy – and , says Chris Gandolfo , vice president of development for Swire ’ s US operations , resilient . “ Starting years ago , Swire was progressive in its thinking on rising tides , ” he says .\n\nGandolfo ticks off some of the adaptation strategies that were used : building higher than the current flood plain ; flood gates that can seal off the underground car park ; an elevated seawall . It also has sustainable features like green roofs , native plants and what the developers have dubbed a “ climate ribbon ” – a walkway that captures the bay winds to cool the structure and lower energy costs , and works as a cistern to re-use rainwater for irrigation . “ We may not make immediate returns , ” Gandolfo says . “ But I think it ’ ll have long-term returns . ”\n\nAll of this puts a catch-22 at the heart of south Florida ’ s development . The state levies no personal or business income taxes and has a low corporate income tax , meaning property taxes provide a major source of revenue . But unless it is managed very carefully , new development brings new challenges .\n\n“ Every one of these buildings that goes up expands your vulnerability and magnitude of risk , ” says Kreeger . “ On the flip side , you ’ re not getting help from the state , because the state legislature and governor are in total denial about climate change . So you ’ re bringing in money today which is going to help you . But you ’ re also bringing a bigger problem tomorrow . ”\n\n*\n\nThinking about any of this is a relatively new trend . Although scientists began speaking about sea level rise for several decades , the topic only saw real traction among local governments and businesses a few years ago .\n\nPart of the reason is that the issue was being ignored by so many others . Most officials say that the Compact , signed in 2010 , has been a major driver in helping local governments collect the data they need and coordinate together on what to do about it – and it was signed after the realisation that , despite concrete problems that had to be solved today , state , federal and international governments weren ’ t doing what was needed to address them .\n\nThe Florida governor is a climate change sceptic and has directed attention away from the issue . Former employees have said they even were told not to utter the phrase “ climate change ” . Ignoring the issue now appears to pervade the highest levels of US government : the new Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) chief doubts whether carbon dioxide plays a primary role in climate change , while President Trump recently signed an executive order overturning emissions-slashing regulations . Draft versions of the White House budget propose cutting the EPA budget by 31 % and employee numbers by 20 % , as well as steep cuts to Noaa – including 26 % of the funds from its Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and entirely eliminating the Sea Grant programme , whose Florida section brings together 17 different universities to study sea level rise challenges and solutions .\n\nLocal governments are forging on , but such circumstances make the challenge even greater . With budgets that run in the tens of millions , not billions , local governments already need to be fiscally creative . Meanwhile , planning depends on up-to-date data – there ’ s no point in raising seawalls if you don ’ t know how high they need to be . And some of the most reliable projection scenarios , as well as sea level rise data , is gathered from Noaa .\n\nYet the impact from these changes won ’ t stop at party lines . Even President Trump ’ s family isn ’ t immune . Three feet of sea level rise – which the range of predictions put together by Compact estimates is likely to happen within the next 60 years – will flood Trump ’ s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach .\n\n“ It doesn ’ t matter if you ’ re a Democrat or Republican commissioner when a neighbour calls you and tells you that their lawn is flooded , ” says Gassman . “ The water doesn ’ t care about politics . The water goes where the water goes . And someone who has a flooding problem that ’ s impacting their quality of life or their property values , they don ’ t care what flavour their politician is . What they care about is that the city is thinking about it , and that they ’ re planning to do something about it . ”\n\n*\n\nSome of the communities in south Florida doing the most to adapt to the effects of sea level rise are doing so largely because of public pressure . In 1993 , Miami-Dade put together its first plan to reduce carbon emissions . Hardly anyone came out for the committee hearing , Yoder says . Fast-forward to 2015 : a hearing on the county ’ s budget was dominated by one resident after another asking why the county wasn ’ t doing more about sea level rise .\n\nSo much so , in fact , that the county decided to hire Murley , its first resilience officer . One of his immediate tasks was to look into getting onto the Rockefeller Foundation ’ s 100 Resilient Cities programme . Accepted cities receive funding and tailored guidance on how to make themselves adaptable to future challenges , from high unemployment to earthquakes and sea-level rise .\n\nGreater Miami is just at the start of the process , Murley says . But he ’ s not the only one hoping that the resources made available will help guide the area far into the future . When I try to get in touch with the commissioners or mayor of Sunny Isles , I get a call back from Brian Andrews , a crisis PR consultant . He says sea level rise is something the city is aware of , but that “ we ’ re waiting for the county ” to gather data and send guidelines for an action plan . “ They ’ re getting millions and millions from the Rockefeller Foundation for this , ” he says . “ We ’ re a little city . We couldn ’ t do it on our own . ”\n\nDespite how awareness of the issue has grown in some communities – particularly those , like Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale , that have seen the most flooding – it ’ s still common for sea-level rise to get shunted to the end of the list of priorities . “ As an elected official , when I go knock on doors , resiliency and sea level rise is never discussed , ” says Esteban Bovo , chair of the Miami-Dade County Commission . “ It ’ s never talked about . It ’ s crime , how much we ’ re going to invest in police , how much we ’ re going to invest in traffic , how much we ’ re going to invest in public safety , libraries – those are the topics of conversation . ”\n\n*\nLater , I find myself playing with the Noaa sea-level tool again . I zoom in on Sunny Isles . At 1ft , the low-lying mangrove swamps of the Oleta River State Park , just over the water , are submerged and the wooded backyard of the Intracoastal Yacht Club disappears . At 2ft , the St Tropez Condominiums and the newly-built Town Center Park are underwater , as are many shops around 172nd Street . At 3ft , things start to get serious . Blue blots out the entire shopping plaza and the Epicure Market . At 4ft , the entire west side of Sunny Isles is uninhabitable . At 6ft , it ’ s gone . Only the spine near the beach – where my father lives – remains .\n\nIt ’ s easy to look at Compact ’ s range of estimates and think that , since a 3ft or 4ft rise may remain fairly far off , everything will be fine for a few more generations . But it ’ s not . With public infrastructure – from fresh water to flushing toilets to roads – woven between communities , if just one area gets affected , others may suffer . Meanwhile , resilience is only one piece . As shown by the Compact chart ’ s steep orange line , if emissions continue to rise , adaptation will become increasingly difficult – if not impossible . And unlike raising seawalls or installing tidal valves , that , of course , can ’ t be controlled by a community or region alone . “ Climate change mitigation to reduce greenhouse gases is a global issue and has to be dealt with globally , ” says Gassman . “ Adaptation to the inevitable effects of climate change is a local issue . ”\n\nLater , peering out the window as my plane takes off over Miami , I no longer see the dense green squares of the city 's western edge , the sharp skyscrapers downtown and the surprisingly slender line of barrier islands . Instead , I see what might be lost . From here , the ocean looks vast .\n\nBut as the plane climbs , I remind myself that human innovation was enough to drain the swamp and make Florida what it is today . It was great enough to get me here , 15,000ft in the air . And it just might be enough to save what I see below .", "label": [[0, 162, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1790, 1978, "False Causality"], [5052, 5219, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [7436, 7686, "Logical Fallacy"], [12707, 12962, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170403-miamis-fight-against-sea-level-rise", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-already-practical-concern-miami-bbc-story-accurately-explores-amanda-ruggeri-bbc/"}
{"id": 522, "data": "Replied Pruitt : “ No . I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do , and there ’ s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact . So no — I would not agree that it ’ s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see . But we don ’ t know that yet . We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis . ”\n\nIt was an accurate and judicious answer , so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation . The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “ denier ” driven by “ unreason. ” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt ’ s views “ extreme ” and “ irresponsible ” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA . Gina McCarthy , who ran the agency under President Obama , bewailed the danger global warming poses “ to all of us who call Earth home , ” and said she couldn ’ t “ imagine what additional information [ Pruitt ] might want from scientists ” in order to understand that .\n\nYet for all the hyperventilating , Pruitt ’ s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate ’ s “ primary control knob ” — was entirely sound . “ We don ’ t know that yet , ” he said . We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .\n\nThere is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred . It should go without saying that if scientists can not yet make accurate predictions about future climate change , then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete .\n\nEarth ’ s climate system is unfathomably complex . It is affected by innumerable interacting variables , atmospheric CO2 levels being just one . The more variables there are in any system or train of events , the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass . Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2 , but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e. , ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable : just 1 in 8 .\n\nApply that approach to climate change , and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists ’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism .\n\nThe list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation , topography , altitude , proximity to the equator , plate tectonics , sunspot cycles , volcanic activity , expansion or contraction of sea ice , conversion of land to agriculture , deforestation , reforestation , direction of winds , soil quality , El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles , prevalence of aerosols ( airborne soot , dust , and salt ) — and , of course , atmospheric greenhouse gases , both natural and manmade . A comprehensive list would run to hundreds , if not thousands , of elements , none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision .\n\nBut for the sake of argument , say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change , and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent . What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable ? Less than 50/50 . ( Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent . ) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record ?\n\nPruitt got it right : Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “ very challenging. ” The science is far from settled . That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don ’ t are little better than reckless fearmongering .", "label": [[197, 396, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [994, 1026, "Ad Hominem"], [1222, 1363, "False Dilemma"], [1575, 1729, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2517, 2637, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3675, 3882, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [4458, 4551, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1222, 1493, "Ad Populum"], [1575, 1729, "Faulty Generalization"], [1851, 2181, "Logical Fallacy"], [2184, 2368, "Circular Reasoning"], [2423, 2636, "Ad Populum"], [2639, 3027, "Faulty Generalization"], [3519, 3671, "Ad Populum"], [3675, 3988, "Faulty Generalization"], [4052, 4247, "Faulty Generalization"], [4338, 4553, "False Dilemma"]], "source_url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2017/03/14/why-are-climate-change-models-flawed-because-climate-science-incomplete/hekwjPBTScRpFyXaXnrWhI/story.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/why-are-climate-change-models-so-flawed-because-climate-science-is-so-incomplete-jeff-jacoby-boston-globe/"}
{"id": 523, "data": "Anew study produced by a University of Wisconsin-Madison geoscientist and Northwestern astrophysicist presents an explanation of the fluctuations of the earth 's temperatures that global warming alarmists are going to make sure to bury : The cycle of changes in the climate over the millennia is a result of changes in the amount of solar radiation , in part caused by small changes in the orbits of Earth and Mars .\n\nWhile the notion that the impact on earth 's orbital cycle on solar radiation levels is the most significant factor determining global temperatures is anything but new , the team of scientists seem to have tied the phenomenon to planetary orbits in a more concrete manner than previous studies .\n\nIn an article summarizing the scientists ' findings , which were originally published this week in the journal Nature , the University of Wisconsin-Madison notes that the study `` provides the first hard proof for what scientists call the 'chaotic solar system , ' a theory proposed in 1989 to account for small variations in the present conditions of the solar system . '' Those variations over millions of years `` produce big changes in our planet ’ s climate . '' Not only does the new discovery promise to provide a better understanding of `` the mechanics of the solar system , '' but also `` a better understanding of the link between orbital variations and climate change over geologic time scales . ''\n\nUW-M provides some more details on the groundbreaking study :\n\nUsing evidence from alternating layers of limestone and shale laid down over millions of years in a shallow North American seaway at the time dinosaurs held sway on Earth , the team led by UW–Madison Professor of Geoscience Stephen Meyers and Northwestern University Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Brad Sageman discovered the 87 million-year-old signature of a “ resonance transition ” between Mars and Earth . A resonance transition is the consequence of the “ butterfly effect ” in chaos theory . It plays on the idea that small changes in the initial conditions of a nonlinear system can have large effects over time .\n\nIn the context of the solar system , the phenomenon occurs when two orbiting bodies periodically tug at one another , as occurs when a planet in its track around the sun passes in relative proximity to another planet in its own orbit . These small but regular ticks in a planet ’ s orbit can exert big changes on the location and orientation of a planet on its axis relative to the sun and , accordingly , change the amount of solar radiation a planet receives over a given area . Where and how much solar radiation a planet gets is a key driver of climate .\n\nOver the ages , the subtle variations in the orbits of Earth and Mars , the scientists theorize , have impacted the amount of Earth 's exposure to solar radiation and thus led to shifts in global temperatures and impacting the pattern of Earth 's ice ages .\n\n`` The impact of astronomical cycles on climate can be quite large , '' explains Meyers , noting as an example the pacing of the Earth ’ s ice ages , which have been reliably matched to periodic changes in the shape of Earth ’ s orbit , and the tilt of our planet on its axis .\n\nWhile evidence that the earth 's orbital variations impact radiation levels and thus global temperatures does not of course mean that man is not in some way impacting the climate , studies like these highlight that the role man plays on the planet is dwarfed by natural phenomena utterly out of our control .", "label": [[2943, 3220, "False Causality"], [3222, 3530, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2684, 2941, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [11, 101, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [175, 235, "Ad Hominem"], [1085, 1182, "Equivocation"], [2699, 2940, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "http://www.dailywire.com/news/13817/scientists-we-know-what-really-causes-climate-james-barrett", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-we-know-what-really-causes-climate-james-barrett-the-daily-wire/"}
{"id": 524, "data": "There 's something about a warm February day that reminds you that something just is n't right . It gives you that nagging feeling that maybe global warming is real after all .\n\nFebruary 2017 has featured prolonged warm weather the likes of which many areas have not seen before , or have only experienced on rare occasions .\n\nTaken as a whole , the month-to-date in the U.S. has seen a ridiculously lopsided ratio of daily record highs to daily record lows , which is a key indicator of short-term weather variability and , over the longer term , human-caused climate change .\n\nFor individual days ' worth of warm weather , you mainly have the jet stream to thank . This current of fast-moving air at about 35,000 feet above the ground has been steering a never-ending series storms into the West Coast , where California 's mountains have picked up a crazy 500 inches of snow so far , and then moved across the U.S. in a way that has cut off flow of frigid air from the Arctic .\n\nWhile transient weather variability is playing a key role here , the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones .\n\nThis February offers a vivid illustration of this trend .\n\nThrough Feb. 23 , daily record highs have been blowing away daily record lows by a far greater than 100-to-1 ratio , which , if it holds for a few more days , would itself set a record . So far this month , there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied , compared to just 42 daily record lows . ( Although this records ratio might need an asterisk , considering the short calendar month . )\n\nAnd it 's not the daily records that are most impressive , but rather the number of monthly records that are being tied or broken from the Gulf Coast all the way to the Midwest and northeastward into Canada . During the past week alone ( not including Feb. 23 ) , there were 736 daily record highs set or tied in the U.S. , compared to zero daily record lows for the same period .\n\nEven more startling is the number of record warm overnight temperatures set or tied in the past seven days , which total a whopping 940 . There were no record cold overnight low temperatures set or tied during the same period .\n\nAnd the monthly records , which are far harder to break than daily milestones , are astounding .\n\nAccording to the National Center for Environmental Information ( NCEI ) in Asheville , North Carolina , February has seen 336 monthly record highs set or tied , along with 203 records set or tied for the warmest overnight minimum temperature . In comparison , there was not a single monthly cold temperature record set or tied through Feb. 23 .\n\nThese figures do not include monthly temperature records that were broken on Friday , which included 73 degrees in Boston , shattering the previous record by 3 degrees Fahrenheit . In addition , Allentown , Pennsylvania hit a remarkable 77 degrees , and Binghamton , New York reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit . Dayton , Cincinatti and Columbus Ohio each either tied or broke their monthly high temperature records on Friday as well , with numerous monthly milestones set on Thursday , too .\n\nIn Albany , New York , the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December , January and February .\n\nOn Wednesday , the record warmth was centered across the Midwest , where the three major cities in Wisconsin ( Milwaukee , Madison and Green Bay ) , all saw temperatures hit record highs for not just February , but for any month during meteorological winter , which encompasses the months of December , January and February .\n\nMilwaukee , for example , broke its monthly all-time record high for February when the temperature reached 71 degrees Fahrenheit , and Madison set a monthly record with a high of 68 degrees Fahrenheit .\n\nIn Ottumwa , Iowa , where the ground would normally be snow-covered this time of year , the high on Wednesday was 79 degrees , which set a monthly record as well . Some cities set records for the longest stretch of February warmth they 've seen , including Kansas City , which set a seven-day February warmth record on Wednesday , according to weather.com .\n\nOn Monday , Chicago had a high temperature of 70 degrees , which was only the fifth time that has happened in any February in the `` Windy City . '' ( The fourth time also came this February . )\n\nThe warm weather in the Midwest was enabled by a marked lack of snow cover and lake ice across the Great Lakes , which allowed air temperatures to soar on mild southwesterly winds for days on end . As of Feb. 22 , just 19.1 percent of the lower 48 states were snow-covered , far below average for this time of year .\n\nWhile cold air is staging a comeback across the Midwest , where heavy snow is predicted to fall from Nebraska into Wisconsin , much of the South and East is likely to stay milder than average for at least a few more days .\n\nThe warm weather in the U.S. has n't been a freak phenomenon only occurring for the past few weeks , either . The year-to-date is averaging a record daily highs to record daily lows ratio of more than 4-to-1 , and studies have shown that over the past several decades , human-caused global warming has increased the odds of warm temperature records so that these ratios are becoming more and more skewed .\n\nAnd the warmth is n't just limited to the U.S. , either , with the planet recording its 3rd-warmest January on record , after its warmest year so far in 2016 . This continues the long-term warming of about 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable surface temperatures began in 1880 .\n\nAs the planet warms in response to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , the ratio of high temperature records compared to low temperature records has become more skewed . If the climate were n't warming , that long-term ratio should average out to about 1-to-1 .\n\nHowever , that is n't the world we 're living in . A 2009 study found that the record highs to lows ratio was 2-to-1 for the lower 48 states during the 2000s , and this disparity has only grown since then , though not evenly across every part of the country . Projections show the imbalance increasing in coming decades as global warming continues , possibly to as high as 15-to-1 if emissions of planet-warming pollutants such as carbon dioxide continue apace .\n\n`` One thing I remind myself when comparing contemporary events to trends or patterns is that the contemporary events themselves make up the trends and patterns , '' said Deke Arndt , who leads the climate monitoring branch at NCEI . `` This is a real-time view into what we will call `` recent trends '' in a few years . ''\n\n`` This week has been an up close look at the DNA of what we are seeing in the big picture : relative to historical norms , extreme heat continues to outpace extreme cold across almost every place , season and time of day in the USA . ''\n\nWhile individual months will still vary from this trend , it 's clear that over the long-term , the ratio of record highs to record lows is now strongly favoring record highs as well as record warm overnight temperatures . This is consistent with computer model projections of a warming world .\n\nIn other words , if you like 70-degree February days in Washington , D.C. , you 're in luck .\n\nThe odds are ( increasingly ) ever in your favor .", "label": [[97, 174, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [0, 94, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://mashable.com/2017/02/23/february-heat-records/#jiOh71fxV5qc", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/heres-why-its-so-frickin-hot-right-now-andrew-freedman-mashable/"}
{"id": 528, "data": "In a powerful testament to the warming of the planet , two leading U.S. science agencies Wednesday jointly declared 2016 the hottest year on record , surpassing the previous record set just last year — which itself had topped a record set in 2014 .\n\nAverage surface temperatures in 2016 , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , were 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2015 and featured eight successive months ( January through August ) that were individually the warmest since the agency ’ s records began in 1880 .\n\nThe average temperature across the world ’ s land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 Fahrenheit , or 1.69 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees , NOAA declared . The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000 . The years 2005 and 2010 were also record warm years , according to the agency ’ s data set .\n\nNASA concurred with NOAA , also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet ’ s land and oceans , and expressing “ greater than 95 percent certainty ” in that conclusion . ( In contrast , NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record . )\n\nNASA found a bigger leap upward of temperatures in 2016 , measuring the year as .22 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the prior record year of 2015 . The agency also noted that since the year 2001 , the planet has seen “ 16 of the 17 warmest years on record . ”\n\nLast year “ is remarkably the third record year in a row in this series , ” said Gavin Schmidt , who directs NASA ’ s Goddard Institute of Space Studies , in a statement . “ We don ’ t expect record years every year , but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear . ”\n\nThe record comes two days before Donald Trump , who has tweeted that global warming is a “ hoax , ” assumes the presidency and , with it , control over the two science agencies that announced these records . It is also the same day that Scott Pruitt , Trump ’ s controversial nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency , is appearing before the Senate in an often-tense confirmation hearing in which he has been questioned about climate change . Pruitt has previously written that the “ debate ” over climate change is “ far from settled . ”\n\nTrump ’ s other nominees , such as State Department nominee Rex Tillerson and Interior Department nominee Ryan Zinke , have been less dismissive of climate change in their confirmation hearings , acknowledging at least some human contribution to the phenomenon but also raising questions either about the extent to which it is human-caused or about our capacity to predict the consequences . On Wednesday , Pruitt acknowledged that climate change is not a “ hoax ” and said that “ the climate is changing , and human activity contributes to that in some manner . ”\n\nScientists have been far less guarded . “ 2016 is a wake-up call in many ways , ” Jonathan Overpeck , a climate scientist at the University of Arizona , said of the year ’ s temperatures . “ Climate change is real , it is caused by humans , and it is serious . ”\n\nNASA and NOAA produce slightly different records using somewhat different methodologies , but have now concurred on identifying 2014 , 2015 and 2016 as , successively , the three warmest years in their records . There was a noticeable difference this year , however , in how much two agencies judged 2016 to have surpassed 2015 . NASA was more bullish — a difference that Schmidt , in a press call Wednesday , attributed to different ways of measuring the Arctic .\n\n“ The warming in the Arctic has really been exceptional , and what you decide to do when you ’ re interpolating across the Arctic makes a difference , ” Schmidt said .\n\nBut the differences between NOAA and NASA aren ’ t that significant , Schmidt further argued , in the context of the bigger picture . “ Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting , and there ’ s lots of technical work that can be done there , but the main take-home response there is that the trends we ’ ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way , ” he said .\n\nHere ’ s a NASA figure showing that long term trend , now updated through 2016 :\n\nLast year ’ s warmth was partly enhanced by a strong weather pattern known as El Niño , but the federal scientists underscore that this was not the only cause . For example , 1998 was also , at the time , the warmest year on record , thanks in part to a strong El Niño — but the 2016 planetary temperature now far surpasses the temperature of that year , as you can see above . The reason is that Earth has been warming since then , allowing another El Niño event , unlocking heat from the vast Pacific Ocean , to push overall temperatures to new heights .\n\n“ This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third ” of the record in 2016 , said Deke Arndt , chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA ’ s National Centers for Environmental Information , on a press call Wednesday .\n\nThus do natural wobbles of the planet ’ s temperature interact with an overall warming trend to produce records on a regular basis . At present , that means that while scientists would expect 2017 to be quite warm , relative to , say , a year in the 1990s , there has been little talk of a fourth record year in a row . And , indeed , El Niño has subsided .\n\nTwo other global agencies , the Japan Meteorological Agency and Britain ’ s Hadley Center , also track global temperatures . On Wednesday , the Hadley Center also announced that 2016 was the warmest year on record , albeit only “ nominally ” because it was very close to 2015 in the agency ’ s data set . The center reported that while 2016 was .77 degrees Celsius above the temperature average between 1961 and 1990 , 2015 was very close at .76 degrees Celsius higher .\n\nThe difference between the Hadley Center and NASA once again comes down to the treatment of the Arctic , Schmidt explained .\n\n“ Our analysis demonstrates that the Arctic is warming around two to three times as fast as the global mean , ” he said . “ So that will be the cause of continuing divergences between the groups , and it ‘ s something I think we all need to be thinking about . ”\n\nNASA further noted in its analysis that compared with the late 19th century , the planet has now warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius , or 2 degrees Fahrenheit . That ’ s significant because the global community has been striving to limit overall warming to considerably below a 2 degree Celsius rise , and even , if possible , to hold it to a 1.5 degree Celsius increase . That is now about .4 degrees away , in Celsius , based on these figures .\n\n“ It is the second year in a row that the annual global temperature has been more than 1 Celsius degree higher than the pre-industrial level , and shows that the world is moving ever closer to the warming threshold of 1.5 Celsius degrees , beyond which many scientists have concluded the impacts of climate change will be unacceptably dangerous , ” said Bob Ward , who is director of policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment , part of the London School of Economics and Political Science .\n\nLast year ’ s warmth was manifested across the planet , from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia , where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death , to the Arctic , where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record , at least from January through September 2016 .\n\nAmong major 2016 events , the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef did not stand alone . In a catalogue of some of the extremes the planet witnessed during the year , NOAA also noted the megafire that engulfed Fort McMurray , in Alberta , Canada , at the beginning of May , relatively early in the year for wildfires . That event was certainly consistent with a warming climate , as well as with the role of El Niño , although scientists are reluctant to formally say that climate change has played a role in an individual event without conducting extensive analysis .\n\nExtreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius ( 123.8 Fahrenheit ) in May , a new national record — to Iran , where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius ( 127.4 F ) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22 .\n\nFor the contiguous United States , 2o16 was merely the second-warmest year on record , but for Alaska , it was the warmest yet recorded , underscoring once again the sharpness of Arctic warmth , in particular .\n\nThe particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way , Overpeck said , noting that the stratosphere , the layer of the planet ’ s atmosphere stretching from about 8.5 to 13.5 miles above us , saw record cold temperatures last year .\n\n“ The pattern of record warmth in the lower atmosphere , coupled with record cold in the stratosphere , provides a clear fingerprint of the cause of the unprecedented warming — greenhouse gases trapping heat in the lower atmosphere instead of letting it escape to the stratosphere , and then to space . No doubt about it anymore — humans , mainly by burning fossil fuels , are cooking the planet , ” Overpeck said .\n\nAll of that said , because of the extreme warmth that occurred early in 2016 , the record just announced does not come as much of a surprise to weather and climate watchers . On April 15 , NASA ’ s Schmidt tweeted : “ Too soon ? I estimate > 99 % chance of an annual record in 2016 in @ NASAGISS temperature data , based on Jan-Mar alone . ”", "label": [[2285, 2342, "Faulty Generalization"], [1832, 2004, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/18/u-s-scientists-officially-declare-2016-the-hottest-year-on-record-that-makes-three-in-a-row/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-officially-declare-2016-hottest-year-record-chris-mooney-the-washington-post/"}
{"id": 529, "data": "There was a breathtakingly beautiful BBC series on the Great Barrier Reef recently which my son pronounced himself almost too depressed to watch . ‘ What ’ s the point ? ’ said Boy . ‘ By the time I get to Australia to see it the whole bloody lot will have dissolved . ’\n\nThe menace Boy was describing is ‘ ocean acidification ’ . It ’ s no wonder he should find it worrying , for it has been assiduously promoted by environmentalists for more than a decade now as ‘ global warming ’ s evil twin ’ . Last year , no fewer than 600 academic papers were published on the subject , so it must be serious , right ?\n\nFirst referenced in a peer-reviewed study in Nature in 2003 , it has since been endorsed by scientists from numerous learned institutions including the Royal Society , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the IPCC . Even the great David Attenborough — presenter of the Great Barrier Reef series — has vouched for its authenticity : ‘ If the temperature rises up by two degrees and the acidity by a measurable amount , lots of species of coral will die out . Quite what happens then is anybody ’ s guess . But it won ’ t be good . ’\n\nNo indeed . Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we ’ ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath . First it will kill off all the calcified marine life , such as shellfish , corals and plankton . Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death .\n\nOr so runs the scaremongering theory . The reality may be rather more prosaic . Ocean acidification — the evidence increasingly suggests — is a trivial , misleadingly named , and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political , ideological and financial reasons .\n\nSome of us have suspected this for some time . According to Patrick Moore , a co-founder of Greenpeace , long one of ocean acidification theory ’ s fiercest critics , the term is ‘ just short of propaganda ’ . The pH of the world ’ s oceans ranges between 7.5 and 8.3 — well above the acid zone ( which starts below ‘ neutral ’ pH7 ) — so more correctly it should be stated that the seas are becoming slightly less alkaline . ‘ Acid ’ was chosen , Moore believes , because it has ‘ strong negative connotations for most people ’ .\n\nMatt Ridley , too , has been scathing on the topic . In The Rational Optimist he wrote , ‘ Ocean acidification looks suspiciously like a back-up plan by the environmental pressure groups in case the climate fails to warm. ’ I agree . That ’ s why I like to call it the alarmists ’ Siegfried Line — their last redoubt should it prove , as looks increasingly to be the case , that the man-made global warming theory is a busted flush .\n\nTo the alarmist camp , of course , this is yet further evidence that ‘ deniers ’ are heartless , anti-scientific conspiracy theorists who don ’ t read peer-reviewed papers and couldn ’ t give a toss if the world ’ s marine life is dissolved in a pool of acid due to man ’ s selfishness and greed . Unfortunately for the doom-mongers , we sceptics have just received some heavy fire-support from a neutral authority .\n\nHoward Browman , a marine scientist for 35 years , has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject . His verdict could hardly be more damning . The methodology used by the studies was often flawed ; contrary studies suggesting that ocean acidification wasn ’ t a threat had sometimes had difficulty finding a publisher . There was , he said , an ‘ inherent bias ’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘ doom and gloom stories ’ .\n\nOcean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start . In 2004 , two NOAA scientists , Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine , produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels . But then , just over a year ago , Mike Wallace , a hydrologist with 30 years ’ experience , noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information . Their chart only started in 1988 but , as Wallace knew , there were records dating back to at least 100 years before . So why had they ignored the real-world evidence in favour of computer-modelled projections ?\n\nWhen Wallace plotted a chart of his own , incorporating all the available data , covering the period from 1910 to the present , his results were surprising : there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century .\n\nEven if the oceans were ‘ acidifying ’ , though , it wouldn ’ t be a disaster for a number of reasons — as recently outlined in a paper by Patrick Moore for the Frontier Centre for Public Policy . First , marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels ; second , they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change ; third , seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH ; fourth , if oceans do become warmer due to ‘ climate change ’ , the effect will be for them to ‘ outgas ’ CO2 , not absorb more of it .\n\nFinally , and perhaps most damningly , Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life . The impact on calcification , metabolism , growth , fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units ( beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century ) is beneficial , not damaging . Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification .\n\nGiven all this , you might well ask why our learned institutions , government departments and media outlets have put so much effort into pretending otherwise . Why , between 2009 and 2014 , did Defra spend a whopping £12.5 million on an ocean acidification research programme when the issue could have been resolved , for next to nothing , after a few hours ’ basic research ?\n\nTo those of us who have been studying the global warming scare in some detail , the answer is depressingly obvious . It ’ s because in the last decade or so , the climate change industry has become so vast and all encompassing , employing so many people , it simply can not be allowed to fail .\n\nAccording to a report last year by Climate Change Business Journal , it ’ s now worth an astonishing $ 1.5 trillion — about the same as the online shopping industry . If the scare goes away , then all bets are off , because the entire global decarbonisation business relies on it . The wind parks , the carbon sequestration projects , the solar farms , the biomass plantations — none of these green schemes make any kind of commercial sense unless you buy into the theory that anthropogenic CO2 is catastrophically warming the planet and that radical green measures , enforced by governmental regulation , must be adopted to avert it .\n\nIt ’ s no coincidence that the ocean acidification narrative began in the early 2000s — just as it was beginning to dawn on the climate alarmists that global temperatures weren ’ t going to plan . While CO2 levels were continuing to rise , temperatures weren ’ t . Hence the need for a fallback position — an environmental theory which would justify the massively expensive and disruptive ongoing decarbonisation programme so assiduously championed by politicians , scientists , green campaigners and anyone making money out of the renewables business . Ocean acidification fitted the bill perfectly .\n\nDoes this prove that global warming is not a problem ? No it doesn ’ t . What it does do is lend credence to something we much-maligned sceptics have long been saying : that in many environmental fields , the science is being abused and distorted to promote a political and financial agenda . Perhaps it ’ s about time our supposed ‘ conspiracy theories ’ were taken more seriously .", "label": [[149, 266, "Faulty Generalization"], [1175, 1628, "Faulty Generalization"], [3205, 3321, "Ad Hominem"], [3325, 3577, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [6009, 6223, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [6592, 6802, "Ad Populum"], [1712, 1936, "Intentional"], [5543, 5845, "Ad Populum"], [7446, 7711, "Ad Hominem"], [7937, 8053, "Intentional"], [331, 498, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [184, 267, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [500, 600, "Ad Populum"], [846, 959, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1771, 1936, "Faulty Generalization"], [5543, 5775, "False Causality"], [6343, 6520, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/ocean-acidification-yet-another-wobbly-pillar-of-climate-alarmism/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/ocean-acidification-yet-another-wobbly-pillar-climate-alarmism-james-delingpole-the-spectator/"}
{"id": 530, "data": "The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America , Europe and Asia , leading climate scientists have told the Guardian .\n\nSevere “ snowmageddon ” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures , say researchers , with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked . The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet ’ s swirling atmosphere , bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil .\n\nThe northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s , with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far . But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists , with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places .\n\nIn November , ice levels hit a record low , and we are now in “ uncharted territory ” , said Prof Jennifer Francis , an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US , who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s .\n\n“ These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now , ” she said . “ In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño , but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic , so it is a whole new ball game .\n\n“ It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south , where so many people live .\n\n“ It ’ s safe to say [ the hot Arctic ] is going to have a big impact , but it ’ s hard to say exactly how big right now . But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we ’ re not going to get around that one . ”\n\nThe chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt . Unlike on the Antarctic continent , melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath , which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further . This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet .\n\nThis in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes , which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind , which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface .\n\nThe jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south , but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker . This means the jet stream meanders more , with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes .\n\nFurthermore , researchers say , the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks , rather than being blown westwards as in the past . This “ blocking ” effect means extreme events can unfold .\n\n“ There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes , both in summer and winter , ” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany . Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010 .\n\n“ A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links , that the physics was not well understood , ” he said . “ But the big question [ now ] is , how important are these mechanisms ? ”\n\nThe other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics , which waxes and wanes with El Niño , while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects .\n\nThe clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions , such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10 , 2010-11 and 2013-14 , causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage .\n\nIn those years , the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions , pulling down savagely cold air . Prof Adam Scaife , a climate modelling expert at the UK ’ s Met Office , said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good : “ The consensus points towards that being a real effect . ”\n\nWhile downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters , the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California . “ These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought , ” said Francis . This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004 , with those researchers now saying : “ Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would . ”\n\nBut the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather , as seen in the past two winters in the UK , leading to severe flooding , said Prof Edward Hanna , at the University of Sheffield in the UK .\n\nHe pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) , a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice . The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century , he said : “ Within the last decade , there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December . ”\n\nThe connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable , according to scientists , but not yet as certain as the winter link .\n\nBlocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events , including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan , which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million , and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year , which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $ 15bn ( £12bn ) of crops .\n\n“ We also see such summer events more often in recent years , ” said Coumou .\n\nBlocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK , leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage .\n\nThe year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland , with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise . The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years : Hurricane Sandy , which killed 233 people and cost $ 75bn in damages .\n\nScientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland , potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer , prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms . Instead , blocked by the high pressure , Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US .\n\nAnother consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come , according to a few scientists : titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe .\n\nThe melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water , which is less dense than salty sea water , into the ocean . As a result , the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium .\n\nThis means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south , which is the driver for storms . In the worst case scenario , said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen , this “ will drive superstorms , stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands ” .\n\nHansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent : 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas .\n\n“ I would certainly not call such [ superstorm ] scenarios ridiculous , ” said Coumou . “ But it is speculative – we don ’ t have the hard evidence . ”\n\nBut even with what is known so far , there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters .\n\n“ The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate , ” said Coumou . “ Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system . ”\n\nAmid the gloomy prospects , there is some cause for hope however . “ A large fraction of the US public still doesn ’ t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system , ” said Francis . “ But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change , that anybody can see them happening . There is no ambiguity whatsoever . ”\n\nBut this changing of minds needs to happen quickly , said Hansen : “ If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly , it may be too late . ”", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now#:~:text=The%20dramatic%20melting%20of%20Arctic,scientists%20have%20told%20the%20Guardian.&text=%E2%80%9CThese%20rapid%20changes%20in%20the,right%20now%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-live-right-now-damian-carrington-the-guardian/"}

{"id": 535, "data": "Hillary Clinton and Al Gore spoke at Miami-Dade College on October 11 about the “ climate crisis ” that Gore has been trying to convince us about for 20 years . Just as in Gore ’ s movie An Inconvenient Truth , weather disasters that have always occurred have been repurposed to support the climate change narrative , with the claim those disasters are getting worse .\n\nMeanwhile , Chapman University has released a survey of the top ten issues Americans fear the most .\n\nGuess what ? Climate change didn ’ t make the list . Instead , corruption of politicians was the No . 1 worry .\n\nFor those who don ’ t see the relationship between these two newsworthy events , let me connect the dots for you .\n\nGlobal warming and climate change , even if it is 100 % caused by humans , is so slow that it can not be observed by anyone in their lifetime . Hurricanes , tornadoes , floods , droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change . This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals ( such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax ) , they have to turn normal weather disasters into “ evidence ” of climate change .\n\nAs a climate researcher , I will agree that humans have likely contributed to a portion of recent warmth . I am not a denier of either natural or human-induced climate change .\n\nBut the observed warming as monitored by satellites ( our only truly global monitoring system ) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening .\n\nFurthermore , the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized . Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past .\n\nLake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past . Strong Sandy-type storms occur every year in all the major ocean basins… they just don ’ t happen to hit major metropolitan areas . It has now , even after Hurricane Matthew , been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane ( Category 3 or stronger ) has made landfall in the U.S .\n\nSea level rise , which was occurring long before humans could be blamed , has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years . If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet , are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade ? If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk , Virginia , she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking .\n\nTo the extent that the cost of weather disasters has risen over time , that is well known to be the result of modern society building more infrastructure in areas that are prone to damage from weather—which is almost everywhere .\n\nSo , to keep the masses alarmed , politicians must claim that what is normal is actually abnormal—and getting worse . And , furthermore , that only they can fix it … and thereby save your children and grandchildren .\n\nAnd it is that “ fix ” that really sinks any current plan politicians have to address climate change . Even the modern godfather of global warming , ex-NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director James Hansen , has admitted that the Paris climate agreement is “ a fraud really , a fake. ” This is because even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change , and that climate change is entirely our fault , and that climate change really will ultimately get bad , the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures .\n\nYou see , many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement aren ’ t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries .\n\nAnd you can ’ t even fix the problem with a new agreement . Why ? Because until we develop a practical , cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels , it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20 % of global energy requirements . The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large . As that demand for energy grows , the amount of renewable energy also has to grow , just to maintain only a 15-20 % fraction of the total .\n\nSo , until people actually experience climate change , and new energy technologies are developed , any claims by politicians that we are in a “ climate crisis ” will fall on deaf ears . And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty , if we allow policymakers to have their way , the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren .\n\nDr. Spencer is also an award-winning NASA scientist and U.S. Science Team Leader on NASA ’ s Aqua Satellite remote sensing program .", "label": [[2699, 2926, "Intentional"], [3459, 3731, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [4477, 4655, "Intentional"], [3735, 3983, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3251, 3442, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [4244, 4468, "Ad Populum"], [4658, 4854, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [0, 158, "Intentional"], [211, 366, "Intentional"], [1377, 1553, "Ad Populum"], [2057, 2201, "Ad Populum"], [2205, 2347, "Ad Populum"], [382, 522, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [701, 842, "Intentional"], [845, 961, "Intentional"], [980, 1191, "Intentional"], [1571, 1996, "Intentional"], [2350, 2506, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2930, 3144, "Ad Hominem"], [485, 581, "False Dilemma"], [1925, 2054, "Logical Fallacy"], [2205, 2276, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2507, 2696, "Ad Hominem"], [2769, 2899, "False Dilemma"], [3735, 3984, "Equivocation"], [4472, 4656, "Faulty Generalization"]], "source_url": "http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/10/25/hillary-clinton-boards-the-climate-crisis-train-to-nowhere/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/hillary-clinton-boards-climate-crisis-train-nowhere-roy-spencer-forbes/"}
{"id": 536, "data": "Once a year or so , journalists from major news outlets travel to the Marshall Islands , a remote chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean , to report in panicked tones that the island nation is vanishing because of climate change . Their dispatches are often filled with raw emotion and suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea .\n\nYet new research shows that this is not the entire—or even an accurate—picture . Acknowledging this doesn ’ t mean that global warming isn ’ t real , or that world leaders and scientists shouldn ’ t tackle the adverse effects of climate change , but hype and exaggeration serve no one .\n\nUsing historic aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery , Auckland University scientists Murray Ford and Paul Kench recently analyzed shoreline changes on six atolls and two mid-ocean reef islands in the Marshall Islands . Their peer-reviewed study , published in the September 2015 issue of Anthropocene , revealed that since the middle of the 20th century the total land area of the islands has actually grown .\n\nHow is that possible ? It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area . However , there is a process of accretion , where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand , counteracting the reduction in land mass . Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise , leading to net land-area gain .\n\nThis is not only true for the Marshall Islands . The researchers write that within the “ recently emerging body of shoreline change studies on atoll islands there is little evidence of widespread reef island erosion . To the contrary , several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [ growth ] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century , resulting in a net increase in island area. ” The most famous of these studies , published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji , showed that of 27 Pacific islands , 14 % lost area . Yet 43 % gained area , with the rest remaining stable .\n\nRepresentatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate . President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation ’ s existence . It ’ s true that approximately one-third of the population has relocated to the U.S.—but for reasons more mundane than climate change .\n\nSome 52.7 % of the Marshall Islands population lives below the poverty line , according to the Asian Development Bank . Only 39.3 % of the population age 15 years and above is employed . In its 2015 human-rights report on the island nation , the U.S. State Department said that significant problems include “ chronic government corruption , and chronic domestic violence , ” along with “ child abuse , sex trafficking , and lack of legal provisions protecting worker ’ s rights. ” Marshallese citizens also have an easy immigration pathway to America and can live , work and study in the U.S. without a visa .\n\nIt is understandable why Marshall Island leaders might prefer to talk about global warming . But blaming today ’ s emigration on rising seas does a disservice to all .\n\nTelling viewers in the U.S. starkly that they ’ re “ making this island disappear , ” as a report from CNN ’ s John Sutter did in June 2015 , makes for good , blame-laden television . But this reductionist , fact-averse rhetoric contributes to the idea that climate-change discussion should be a two-sided , cartoonish fight between those who say it is not real and those who say it is the worst problem facing humanity .\n\nEven more insidiously , doom-mongering makes us panic and seize upon the wrong responses to global warming . At a cost of between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion annually , the Paris climate agreement , recently ratified by China , is likely to be history ’ s most expensive treaty . It will slow the world ’ s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources .\n\nThis will achieve almost nothing . My peer-reviewed research , published last November in the journal Global Policy , shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $ 100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F ( 0.17°C ) .\n\nIn a rush to do something—and be seen to be taking drastic action—more sensible approaches to counter global warming have been overlooked . Instead of simply mandating less carbon output , we need more R & D spending on green energy , including more efficient fission and fusion , cheaper solar and wind , and improved storage . New technology is crucial if green energy is to out-compete fossil fuels .\n\nPolicy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands ’ resilience and ability to cope with severe weather by improving infrastructure and storm preparedness . Tackling issues like poverty , health care , corruption and domestic violence would do even more . Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind .", "label": [[20, 253, "Intentional"], [20, 253, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [466, 669, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1365, 1477, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2755, 3046, "Ad Hominem"], [2568, 2752, "Ad Hominem"], [4053, 4148, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [4281, 4527, "Ad Populum"], [4720, 4932, "Intentional"], [5154, 5314, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3880, 4050, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3180, 3269, "Ad Hominem"], [3401, 3429, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/about-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-1476400840", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-bjorn-lomborg-wall-street-journal/"}
{"id": 540, "data": "NORFOLK , Va. — Huge vertical rulers are sprouting beside low spots in the streets here , so people can judge if the tidal floods that increasingly inundate their roads are too deep to drive through .\n\nFive hundred miles down the Atlantic Coast , the only road to Tybee Island , Ga. , is disappearing beneath the sea several times a year , cutting the town off from the mainland .\n\nAnd another 500 miles on , in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , increased tidal flooding is forcing the city to spend millions fixing battered roads and drains — and , at times , to send out giant vacuum trucks to suck saltwater off the streets .\n\nFor decades , as the global warming created by human emissions caused land ice to melt and ocean water to expand , scientists warned that the accelerating rise of the sea would eventually imperil the United States ’ coastline .\n\nNow , those warnings are no longer theoretical : The inundation of the coast has begun . The sea has crept up to the point that a high tide and a brisk wind are all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes .\n\nFederal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called “ sunny-day flooding ” — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years . The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly . Shifts in the Pacific Ocean mean that the West Coast , partly spared over the past two decades , may be hit hard , too .\n\nThese tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep , but they can stop traffic , swamp basements , damage cars , kill lawns and forests , and poison wells with salt . Moreover , the high seas interfere with the drainage of storm water .\n\nIn coastal regions , that compounds the damage from the increasingly heavy rains plaguing the country , like those that recently caused extensive flooding in Louisiana . Scientists say these rains are also a consequence of human greenhouse emissions .\n\n“ Once impacts become noticeable , they ’ re going to be upon you quickly , ” said William V. Sweet , a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring , Md. , who is among the leaders in research on coastal inundation . “ It ’ s not a hundred years off — it ’ s now . ”\n\nLocal governments , under pressure from annoyed citizens , are beginning to act . Elections are being won on promises to invest money to protect against flooding . Miami Beach is leading the way , increasing local fees to finance a $ 400 million plan that includes raising streets , installing pumps and elevating sea walls .\n\nIn many of the worst-hit cities , mayors of both parties are sounding an alarm .\n\n“ I ’ m a Republican , but I also realize , by any objective analysis , the sea level is rising , ” said Jason Buelterman , the mayor of tiny Tybee Island , one of the first Georgia communities to adopt a detailed climate plan .\n\nBut the local leaders say they can not tackle this problem alone . They are pleading with state and federal governments for guidance and help , including billions to pay for flood walls , pumps and road improvements that would buy them time .\n\nYet Congress has largely ignored these pleas , and has even tried to block plans by the military to head off future problems at the numerous bases imperiled by a rising sea . A Republican congressman from Colorado , Ken Buck , recently called one military proposal part of a “ radical climate change agenda . ”\n\nThe gridlock in Washington means the United States lacks not only a broad national policy on sea-level rise , it has something close to the opposite : The federal government spends billions of taxpayer dollars in ways that add to the risks , by subsidizing local governments and homeowners who build in imperiled locations along the coast .\n\nAs the problem worsens , experts are warning that national security is on the line . Naval bases , in particular , are threatened ; they can hardly be moved away from the ocean , yet much of their land is at risk of disappearing within this century .\n\n“ It ’ s as if the country was being attacked along every border , simultaneously , ” said Andrea Dutton , a climate scientist at the University of Florida and one of the world ’ s leading experts on rising seas . “ It ’ s a slow , gradual attack , but it threatens the safety and security of the United States . ”\n\n‘ We ’ re Living It ’\nOne night eight years ago , Karen Speights , a Norfolk resident , was sitting at the dinner table with her mother , eating crab legs dipped in butter and a tangy sauce . She felt a tingle .\n\n“ Ma ! ” she cried . “ My feet are wet ! ”\n\nHer mother laughed , but then she felt it , too : a house that had not flooded since the family moved there in 1964 was soon awash in saltwater . Ms. Speights initially hoped that flood was a fluke . Instead , it turned out to be the first of three to hit their home in less than a decade .\n\nNowadays , Ms. Speights , an administrative worker at a utility company , is wondering how to get her and her mother out of the neighborhood before the water comes again , without taking too much of a financial hit . And she pays more attention to problems that once seemed remote , like warnings from scientists about the rising sea .\n\n“ I believe it because we ’ re living it , ” Ms. Speights said as she sat on her sofa , nodding toward the nearby tidal marsh that sent water into her living room . “ The water has to be rising if we never flooded , and all of a sudden we ’ ve flooded three times in eight years . ”\n\nBecause the land is sinking as the ocean rises , Norfolk and the metropolitan region surrounding it , known as Hampton Roads , are among the worst-hit parts of the United States . That local factor means , in essence , that the region is a few decades ahead in feeling the effects of sea-level rise , and illustrates what people along the rest of the American coast can expect .\n\nThe biggest problems involve frequent flooding of homes and roads . As the sea rises , hundreds of tidal creeks and marshes that thread through the region are bringing saltwater to people ’ s doorsteps .\n\nThis summer , on a driving tour of Norfolk and nearby towns , William A. Stiles Jr. pointed to the telltale signs that the ocean is gradually invading the region .\n\nHe spotted crusts of dried salt in the streets , and salt-loving marsh grasses that are taking over suburban yards . He pointed out trees killed by seawater . He stood next to one of the road signs that Norfolk has been forced to install in recent years , essentially huge vertical rulers so people know the depth of floodwaters at low-lying intersections .\n\n“ There ’ s just more and more visible impacts : water on the street , water that won ’ t clear from the ditch , these intense rain events , higher tides , ” Mr. Stiles said .\n\n“ It ’ s beginning to catch the attention of citizens , restaurant owners , business people , politicians . There ’ s just much more of a conversation , and it ’ s not just in the politically safe places . It ’ s everywhere . ”\n\nMr. Stiles , known as Skip , heads a local environmental group , Wetlands Watch . At his suggestion , students at two local universities began looking at the neighborhood where Ms. Speights lives , Chesterfield Heights . It has had little history of flooding , but that is starting to change as the water rises .\n\nThe plan the students developed has morphed into an ambitious program to safeguard the neighborhood , and another nearby , for decades . The Obama administration recently gave Virginia more than $ 100 million to carry the plan out . The administration has also enlisted one of the universities , Old Dominion in Norfolk , to spearhead a broad effort at better planning .\n\nBut the size of that grant illustrates the scope of the problem confronting the region , and the country : protecting a single neighborhood from rising water can easily cost tens of millions of dollars . Sea walls and streets may have to be raised , or movable gates built along waterways so they can be closed at times of high water .\n\nWhile the Obama administration is trying to create a few showcase neighborhoods , there is no sign Congress is prepared to spend the money that cities and states say they need : tens of billions of dollars just to catch up to the current flooding problems , much less get ahead of them . Norfolk alone , a town of 250,000 people , has a wish list of $ 1.2 billion — or about $ 5,000 for every man , woman and child in the city .\n\nAs the national response lags , experts warn that the flooding is putting the country ’ s defense at risk .\n\nSeveral studies have concluded that Naval Station Norfolk , the world ’ s largest naval base , is profoundly threatened by rising seas , as are other coastal bases . The Pentagon has managed to build floodgates and other protective measures at some facilities . But attempts by the military to develop broader climate change plans have met fierce resistance in Congress .\n\nThat was the case this summer , when an effort by the Pentagon to appoint officers to take charge of climate resilience led to a House vote prohibiting taxpayer money from being spent on the plan .\n\n“ When we distract our military with a radical climate change agenda , we detract from their main purpose of defending America from enemies ” like the Islamic State , said Mr. Buck of Colorado , the Republican congressman who sponsored the measure . His amendment passed the House 216 to 205 , though the Senate has yet to agree to it .\n\nMany people in Congress , almost all of them Republicans , express doubt about climate science , with some of them promulgating conspiracy theories claiming that researchers have invented the issue to justify greater governmental control over people ’ s lives . So far , this ideological position has been immune to the rising evidence of harm from human-induced climate change .\n\nThe Obama administration has been pushing federal agencies , including the Pentagon , to take more aggressive steps . But without action in Congress , experts say these efforts fall far short of what is required .\n\n“ In the country , certainly in the Congress , it hasn ’ t really resonated — the billions and perhaps trillions of dollars that we would need to spend if we want to live on the coast like we ’ re living today , ” said David W. Titley , a retired rear admiral who was the chief oceanographer of the Navy , and now heads a climate center at Pennsylvania State University .\n\n“ I haven ’ t seen any evidence that there is serious thought about this : What does a world of three , four , five feet of sea-level rise look like ? ”\n\nMounting Evidence\nDeep in a thicket of trees on an out-of-the-way island in the Florida Keys , a diesel engine roared to life . Soon a drill bit was chewing through ancient limestone , pulling up evidence from the geological past that might shed light on the future of the planet .\n\nOn a sultry day in March , Dr. Dutton , the University of Florida scientist , stood watch over the drilling operation , inspecting her samples as they emerged from the ground . She spotted fossilized corals , proof that what is now the dry ground of Lignumvitae Key was once underwater .\n\nWith taxpayer funding from the National Science Foundation , Dr. Dutton is chasing what might be the most urgent question in climate science : How fast is the ocean going to rise ?\n\n“ Is it going to happen in decades , or centuries , or a thousand years ? ” Dr. Dutton asked as she took a break to eat lunch on a tarpaulin spread under the trees . “ This will give us an example to say , ‘ Well , the last time this happened , here is how long it took . ’ ”\n\nThe opponents of climate science in Congress , and the tiny group of climate researchers allied with them , have argued that the concerns of thousands of mainstream scientists about the future are based on unproven computer forecasts .\n\nIn reality , their concerns are based in large part on mounting evidence of what has happened in the past .\n\nThrough decades of research , it has become clear that human civilization , roughly 6,000 years old , developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels . But over longer spans , coastlines have been much more dynamic .\n\nDuring ice ages , caused by wobbles in the Earth ’ s orbit , sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land . But during periods slightly warmer than today , the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the current level .\n\nDr. Dutton and other leading scientists are focused on the last sea-level high point , which occurred between the last two ice ages , about 125,000 years ago .\n\nAfter years of surveying ancient shorelines around the world , scientists determined that the sea level rose by something like 20 to 30 feet in that era , compared with today . But how long did it take to make that jump ? That is the question Dr. Dutton , using improved research techniques , wants to answer .\n\nLarge parts of the Florida Keys are simply ancient coral reefs that grew during the period of high seas , and were exposed when the levels fell . Trees , roads and houses now sit atop the old reefs . By recovering samples , Dr. Dutton hopes to date a sequence of corals as they grew along with the rising sea , potentially revealing the rate at which the water rose .\n\nThe research , likely to take years , may supply a figure for how quickly the ocean was able to rise under past conditions , but not necessarily a maximum rate for the coming decades . The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly , perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth ’ s history . The ice sheets in both Greenland and West Antarctica are beginning to melt into the sea at an accelerating pace .\n\nScientists had long hoped that any disintegration of the ice sheets would take thousands of years , but recent research suggests the breakup of West Antarctica could occur much faster . In the worst-case scenario , this research suggests , the rate of sea-level rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century , about 10 times faster than today .\n\nIn 2013 , scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100 . But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible . A rise that large over a span of decades would be an unparalleled national catastrophe , driving millions of people from their homes and most likely requiring the abandonment of entire cities .\n\nIn essence , by revealing how sensitive the ice sheets have been to past warming , Dr. Dutton ’ s research may answer the question of whether such a rapid jump is possible .\n\nAlong those parts of the United States coast that are sinking at a brisk clip , including southern Louisiana and the entire Chesapeake Bay region , including Norfolk , the situation will be worse than average . On the Pacific Coast , a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending , so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California .\n\nAlong the East Coast , scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that many communities have already , or will soon , pass a threshold where sunny-day flooding starts to happen much more often .\n\n“ When you look at the historical record , there ’ s no trend saying the flooding is going down , ” said Dr. Sweet , the NOAA expert . “ The trends are all very clear . They ’ re going up , and they ’ re going up in many of these areas in an accelerating fashion . ”\n\nLate last year , in Paris , nations reached a landmark global agreement to cut emissions . It is fragile , and might not survive if Donald J. Trump is elected president in November ; he has pledged to scrap it .\n\nBut the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt . So even if the deal survives , it will , at best , slow the rise of the sea and perhaps limit the ultimate increase . Many climate scientists , including Dr. Dutton , believe a rise of at least 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable , over an unknown period .\n\nFacing Hard Decisions\nAs Brad Tuckman walked the piece of land in Fort Lauderdale where he is building a grand new house , he pointed toward the canal that wraps around three sides of the property .\n\nIt is scenic , with yachts plying the water , yet as the sea has risen , street flooding in the area has become a recurring nuisance . So before starting construction , Mr. Tuckman said he spent nearly a half-million dollars to raise the sea wall and truck in dirt to elevate the land .\n\n“ The predictions of what ’ s going to happen over the next 20 , 30 , 40 years — it ’ s real , ” said Mr. Tuckman , the founder of a company offering creative services to the retail industry .\n\nIn South Florida , among the worst-hit parts of the country for sunny-day flooding , people are not waiting for state or federal help . Those who can afford it are starting to act on their own . A company , Coastal Risk Consulting , has cropped up to advise them , and is offering its services nationally .\n\nCities and counties in the region have formed an alliance and enlisted professors to help them figure out what to do . They are hiring “ chief resilience officers , ” an idea pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York , which is paying some of the salary cost .\n\nIn Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale , as well as in older Northern cities like Boston and New York , tidal marshes and creeks were filled in a century or more ago to make new land , and it is in these areas — “ back bays , ” as some of these spots are called — where the flooding is happening first .\n\nThat is because they remain the lowest spots in the landscape , vulnerable to the rising water nearby . Old drain pipes empty into the tidal creeks , and at high tide the water can back up through these pipes , bubbling into the streets seemingly from nowhere .\n\nIn Miami Beach , the city engineer , Bruce A. Mowry , has come up with a plan for combating the flooding . He rips up problematic streets , raises them with extra dirt and repaves them , installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay . The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods .\n\nA controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water , but the city is pushing ahead . Miami Beach plans to spend at least $ 400 million on its plan by 2018 , raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses .\n\nThe huge county government for the region , Miami-Dade County , is developing its own resilience strategy , one likely to cost billions . It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure , like a sewage plant , in a way that safeguards against sea-level rise and storm surges .\n\n“ I don ’ t see doom and gloom here ; I see opportunity , ” said Harvey Ruvin , the clerk of courts for Miami-Dade County , who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a half-century , and who recently led a county task force on sea-level rise . “ We ’ re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of , and one that can ’ t be outsourced . ”\n\nMany of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change , as well as pushing local steps . James C. Cason , the Republican mayor of Coral Gables , has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents , and he has received no complaints for his stance .\n\n“ I hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money , the citizens will still support it , ” Mr. Cason said in an interview .\n\nStill , his city , and others in South Florida , have some hard decisions to make .\n\nSome property owners can not afford to raise their sea walls , putting their neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding . Will they be held legally responsible when floods do occur ? A strict policy could force some people from their homes . Conversely , should public money be spent to do the work , even if it largely benefits private property ?\n\nJust for streets , storm drains and the like , South Florida governments will need to raise billions , and they have yet to figure out how . Moreover , if the rise of the sea accelerates as much as some scientists fear , it is doubtful the cities will be able to keep up .\n\nThe region has one mayor , Philip K. Stoddard of South Miami , who is a scientist himself — he studies animal communication at Florida International University — and has been a close reader of scientific papers about climate change since the 1990s .\n\n“ I remember lying in bed at night thinking , ‘ I hope this isn ’ t real , ’ ” Dr. Stoddard , a Democrat , recalled . “ I hope other data comes in that contradicts it . It took me several years to get my head around it and say , ‘ Oh , God , it is real . ’ ”\n\nNow he is focused on easing the pain for South Miami , with a $ 50 million system of sewer pipes to replace septic tanks threatened by the rising water table .\n\n“ You can play it really badly and let unpleasant things happen earlier , ” he said . “ Or you can push them off by doing some infrastructure repairs and some thoughtful planning . ”\n\nHe is , though , under no illusions about the long-term fate of the region he calls home .\n\n“ We ’ re putting enough heat in the ocean to send water over us , no question , ” Dr. Stoddard said . “ Ultimately , we give up and we leave . That ’ s how the story ends . ”", "label": [[3337, 3468, "Ad Hominem"], [21488, 21661, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [939, 1068, "Faulty Generalization"], [2690, 2783, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [2985, 3334, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [3337, 3472, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [3816, 3945, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4070, 4149, "Faulty Generalization"], [4284, 4378, "Faulty Generalization"], [5270, 5432, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [8522, 8627, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [9203, 9367, "Faulty Generalization"], [9203, 9367, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [14359, 14550, "Faulty Generalization"], [20038, 20263, "False Dilemma"], [15382, 15642, "Ad Populum"], [16721, 16911, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [20417, 20535, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [21211, 21393, "False Dilemma"]], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/science/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun-justin-gillis-the-new-york-times/"}
{"id": 541, "data": "Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic , making more than 50 trips there , some in submarines under the polar ice . He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink . He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001 . His book , A Farewell to Ice , tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate .\n\nYou have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade . It hasn ’ t . Are you being alarmist ?\nNo . There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover . However , each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away . The overall trend is a very strong downward one , however . Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic ’ s summer sea-ice cover . Next year or the year after that , I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free . You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship . There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline . Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018 .\n\nWhy should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer ?\nPeople tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change . Things happen , they say . In fact , the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population . One key effect will be albedo feedback . Sea ice reflects about 50 % of the solar radiation it receives back into space . By contrast , water reflects less than 10 % . So if you replace ice with water , which is darker , much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present .\n\nSea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system . Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further . These effects could add 50 % to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions .\n\nWhat will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures ?\nThe air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt . It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year . Antarctica is adding to the melt as well . Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result . The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century . I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely . Indeed , it is probably the best we can hope for .\n\nThat may not sound a lot but it is really very serious . It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world . We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh , it just means more and more people will be drowned .\n\nGlobal warming is generally associated with increased fossil-fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide . But is that the only climate problem we face ?\nNo it is not . We also have the issue of methane . Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed . The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic icecaps .\n\nUntil around 2005 , even in summer , you still had sea ice near the coast . Then it started to disappear , so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age . It has started to melt with dangerous consequences . Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates . When the permafrost goes , you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution .\n\nCan we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide ?\nYes , we can measure methane over large areas using satellites . These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating , often with little outliers on the graph . There is a scientist called Jason Box who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon ’ s breath . They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments . They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes .\n\nHow intense is methane as a heater of the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide ?\nIt is 23 times more powerful . However , methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide . It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years . By contrast , carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100 years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed . At least that is what scientists thought . Today , there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere .\n\nSo in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away . But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect . All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere . We are having to live with last century ’ s carbon dioxide . What that says is simple : there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide . That is why I am despondent about us ever being able to cut carbon emissions .\n\nIf we can not halt the emissions of carbon dioxide , what can we do ?\nIn the end , the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there . Even the IPCC has admitted that we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air . The trouble is that they don ’ t just how we can do that . The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS : bio-energy with carbon capture and storage . Essentially , you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground . These grow , absorbing carbon dioxide in the process . Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping , liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released .\n\nIt sounds straightforward . Will it work ?\nI am a bit suspicious of this technology . BECCS will need so much land to be effective . Calculations suggest it would need 40 % to 50 % of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants . Other techniques , such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks , which absorb carbon dioxide , on beaches , will simply not scale up . They won ’ t work , so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly .\n\nAs far as I can see , it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end . It can be done , I am sure , but at the moment we do not have such a device . However , without something like that I can not see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere . We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed . That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us . I think humanity can do it , but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology .", "label": [[621, 774, "False Dilemma"], [5270, 5428, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [7020, 7282, "Ad Populum"], [973, 1063, "Ad Populum"], [5474, 5588, "Ad Populum"], [3268, 3392, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/21/arctic-will-be-ice-free-in-summer-next-year", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/arctic-will-be-ice-free-in-summer-next-year-robin-mckie-peter-wadhams-the-guardian/"}
{"id": 542, "data": "The historic and are the latest in a series of heavy deluges that some climate scientists warn will become even more common as the world continues to warm .\n\nOn Tuesday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once-in-every-500-years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months .\n\nSince May of last year , dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes have been swamped with water in extreme events in Oklahoma , Texas , South Carolina , West Virginia and Maryland . Noaa considers these floods extreme because , based on historical rainfall records , they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years .\n\nThe Louisiana flooding has been so exceptional that some places in the state experienced storm conditions considered once-every-1,000-year events . Close to 2ft of rain fell over a 48-hour period in parts of southern Louisiana , causing residents to scramble to safety from flooded homes and cars .\n\nAt least six people have died , with another 20,000 people having to be rescued . Even Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards had to evacuate after his governor ’ s mansion in Baton Rouge was swamped with chest-high water . A federal state of emergency has been declared , with 12,000 people crowding into shelters .\n\nThe National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near-record levels of atmospheric moisture , prompting the service to state : “ We are in record territory. ” Climate scientists have warned that the build-up of moisture in the atmosphere , driven by warming temperatures , is likely to cause a greater number of floods in the future .\n\n“ We have been on an upward trend in terms of heavy rainfall events over the past two decades , which is likely related to the amount of water vapor going up in the atmosphere , ” said Dr Kenneth Kunkel , of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites .\n\n“ There ’ s a very tight loop – as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up , the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere . We ’ re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods . ”\n\nThe number of heavy rainfall events in the US has risen well above the long-term average since the 1990s , with large regional variances . While the north-east , midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30 % increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once-in-every-five year downpours – parts of the west , particularly California , have been parched by drought .\n\nWarmer air , influenced by heat-trapping gases released by human activity , can contain more water vapor than cooler air . With the extra heat helping nourish storms , scientists expect global warming to help produce more intense downpours .\n\n“ Assuming we don ’ t change our ways , warming is a virtual certainty and increased water vapor is virtual certainty , ” Kunkel said . “ That means increases in heavy rainfall is virtual certainty . ”\n\nWhile scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate , they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation . Some , however , bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred , they should not be linked to climate change .\n\nDr Kevin Trenberth , senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said the major floods seen in the US had a “ clear human component in them . I have seen only a few reports and none mention climate change at all . It is pathetic . ”\n\nThere are plenty of influences on rainfall levels , including natural variation and topography . One of the biggest variables will be how much warmer the world will become – Trenberth said each 1C increase in temperature can add 7 % more moisture in the atmosphere . But plotting exact projections between warming and the magnitude of downpours is something scientists are still working on .\n\n“ Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform , ” states the latest IPCC assessment . “ The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase , although there may be regional exceptions . ”\n\nWith the US suffering more weather-related disasters than any other country , an increase in rainfall , storm and hurricane intensity is something that could start demanding more attention from lawmakers .\n\n“ It ’ s prudent to consider that if you ’ re building something with a 100-year lifetime , it ’ s virtually certain that it will experience an increase in extreme rainfall , ” Kunkel said . “ We either pay now or pay later . If we build resiliency into infrastructure , we can protect life and property . ”", "label": [[4697, 4813, "False Dilemma"]], "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change-oliver-milman-the-guardian/"}
{"id": 546, "data": "Earlier this month , NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener , as viewed from space , especially in its rapidly warming northern regions . And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air , along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons , makes plants very , very happy .\n\nNow , new research in Nature Climate Change not only reinforces the reality of this trend — which is already provoking debate about the overall climate consequences of a warming Arctic — but statistically attributes it to human causes , which largely means greenhouse gas emissions ( albeit with a mix of other elements as well ) .\n\nThe roughly three-decade greening trend itself is apparent , the study notes , in satellite images of “ leaf area index ” — defined as “ the amount of leaf area per ground area , ” as Robert Buitenwerf of Aaarhus University in Denmark explains in a commentary accompanying the study — across most of the northern hemisphere outside of the tropics , a region sometimes defined as the “ extratropics. ” Granted , there are a few patches in Alaska , Canada and Eurasia where greening has not been seen .\n\nStarting from this set of observations , the researchers , led by Jiafu Mao of Oak Ridge National Laboratory but including 18 others from multiple institutions in the United States , France , and China , conducted what scientists call a “ detection and attribution ” study . This is an experiment in which differing sets of climate model runs are used to determine whether a particular event or change — ranging from an extreme heat wave , to a coral bleaching event , to a major trend like Arctic greening — is more likely to happen in simulations that include human greenhouse gas emissions , than it is to happen in those that do not .\n\nSure enough , the greenhouse-gas filled computer simulations looked much more like the satellite observations than did simulations that only included natural variability . The study therefore concludes that “ the trend of strengthened northern vegetation greening … can be rigorously attributed , with high statistical confidence , to anthropogenic forcings , particularly to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases . ”\n\nWhile this formal detection and attribution appears to be new , the report is at least the third study in the past several months alone to highlight northern hemisphere greening and to reinforce this basic conclusion . It ’ s one that has often been celebrated by climate change skeptics and contrarians who have long contended that global warming won ’ t be all bad , and that plants might help offset any global warming trend .\n\n“ We first find this kind of human fingerprint … particularly the greenhouse gas impact , on this kind of enhanced vegetation growth , ” says Mao , the study ’ s lead author .\n\nThe researchers also dove in more closely to try to determine precisely why so much greening is happening in the Northern Hemisphere ’ s colder latitudes . Sure enough , the overall trend was tied to warmer temperatures , although in areas where greening was missing , declining precipitation trends seemed to partly explain the result as well . ( The study did not discuss whether growing wildfires in northern forests may also be countering greening in some areas . )\n\nAnother factor enhancing plant growth , meanwhile , seems to be more human-induced falling of nitrogen out of the atmosphere , as we have amped up the global nitrogen cycle with our fertilizers and our fossil fuels ( nitrogen also can enhance plant growth ) .\n\nIn his accompanying essay evaluating the research , Aarhus University ’ s Buitenwerf praises the study but notes that in some ways , the current satellite-based approach represents a blunt instrument . An examination of total leaf area , he notes , doesn ’ t record whether a particular area has changed its type of vegetation , say from smaller tundra shrubs to small trees .\n\nBuitenwerf also notes that the science is less clear about what is happening in the global tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere , where greening trends are either less apparent , or more difficult to explain .\n\nStill , the subtext of all of this research is clear — a key fraction of all the greenhouse gases that humans pour into the atmosphere each year is pulled back into plants through the process of photosynthesis . This is happening even as the overall warming of the planet may , by lengthening growing seasons and moistening the atmosphere , further stoke plant growth . They don ’ t call it the “ greenhouse effect ” for nothing .\n\nThe key question then becomes how much this process can offset overall global warming over time . And that ’ s quite unclear .\n\nThere ’ s a lot , after all , that we don ’ t understand . For instance , a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report found that while Arctic tundras have indeed been greening over the past 30 years , in the past two to four years , that trend has reversed itself .\n\n“ Although we already identify this kind of human impact on this historical vegetation growth , for the future , it ’ s hard to predict , ” says Mao . He said he is not sure to what extent the greening trend will continue , as “ disturbances ” like wildfires might counteract it , or plants may become “ acclimated to this kind of high temperature . ”\n\nStill , the trend is already prompting more optimistic assessments of our climate future in some quarters . Arctic greening was recently cited , in a major report by the U.S. Geological Survey , as the central reason that the state of Alaska , despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost , might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century .\n\nIt is clear , then , that greening is emerging as a factor with the potential to blunt some of the worst impacts of human greenhouse gas emissions . But thus far , researchers do not seem to be arguing that it ’ s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend .\n\n“ While we are perhaps lucky that CO2 has this effect on plant physiology , in addition to being a greenhouse gas , it is not our ‘ get out of jail free ’ card when it comes to our ongoing emissions of CO2 , ” climate scientist Richard Betts of the U.K. ’ s Hadley Centre wrote recently .\n\nInstead , global greening is perhaps better taken as yet another indicator , visible from space , of how much we are causing the Earth to change .\n\n“ Given the strong evidence provided here of historical human induced greening in the northern extratropics , society should consider both intended and unintended consequences of its interactions with terrestrial ecosystems and the climate system , ” the new study concludes .", "label": [[2613, 2707, "False Dilemma"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/06/27/its-official-humans-are-making-the-earth-much-greener/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/its-official-humans-are-making-the-earth-much-greener-washington-post-chris-mooney/"}
{"id": 547, "data": "Last week , a study in the prestigious journal Nature revealed just how much CO₂ increases have greened the Earth over the past three decades . Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer , as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today . This ought to be a cause for great joy .\n\nInstead , the BBC focused on warning that the paper shouldn ’ t make us stop worrying about global warming , with threats like melting glaciers and more severe tropical storms . Many other major news outlets did not even report on the study .\n\nOur climate conversation is lopsided . There is ample room to suggest that climate change has caused this problem or that negative outcome , but any mention of positives is frowned upon . We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century , it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent .\n\nSimilarly , we know that many more people die from cold than from heat . The biggest study on heat and cold deaths , published last year in Lancet , examined more than 74 million deaths from 384 locations in 13 countries from cold Sweden to hot Thailand . The researchers found that heat causes almost one-half of one percent of all deaths , while more than 7 percent are caused by cold .\n\nAs global warming pushes temperatures up , more people will die in heat waves ; a point emphasized by campaigners like UN climate chief , Christiana Figueres . What we don ’ t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold . One study for England and Wales shows that heat kills 1,500 annually and cold kills 32,000 . By the 2080s , increased heat-waves will kill nearly 5,000 in a comparable population . But ‘ cold deaths ’ will have dropped by 10,000 , meaning 6,500 fewer die altogether .\n\nOnly mentioning the negatives distorts and degrades the political conversation . Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour . It is an extreme partisan that insists either side offers only negatives .\n\nYet , this is the position enforced by the climate alarmists – last seen in a letter to The Times from Lord Krebs and company , essentially telling the newspaper to stop reporting less-than-negative climate stories . While it is true any individual news story rarely represents the whole truth , it is revealing that such campaigners don ’ t send out similar letters to correct the daily deluge of alarmist stories .\n\nThe idea that climate is bad for all good things and good for all bad things belongs in a morality play . In the real world , we should look at all the available information . When the BBC warns of more severe tropical storms , it has some validity . The UN ’ s climate panel expects to see fewer but stronger hurricanes . But it is an incomplete picture .\n\nAs the world develops , it has become much less vulnerable : a hurricane hitting Florida kills few people while a similar event in Guatemala kills tens of thousands . Indeed , climate-related deaths have dropped from half a million per year in the 1920s to less than 25,000 per year in the 2010s . A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP , because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience .\n\nWhen the BBC warns of melting glaciers it is reminiscent of Al Gore ’ s concern that 40 per cent of the world get drinking water from the Himalayas , and melting glaciers mean “ those 40 per cent of the people on Earth are going to face a very serious shortage. ” Yet , a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases . Indeed , water flow will actually increase over this century , which is likely beneficial in increasing “ water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons . ”\n\nIf our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad , we would have a much better understanding of our options . Climate economics does just that , taking all the negatives ( like rising sea levels and more heat deaths ) and all the positives ( a greener planet , fewer cold deaths ) . A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists ’ massive insistence on negatives-only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits . Over time , climate becomes a net problem : by the 2070s , the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP . This is certainly not a trivial cost , but nor is it the end of the world . It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today .\n\nThis suggests that a policy which could eradicate global warming for 1 per centof global GDP would probably be a good deal . Unfortunately , we do not have such a deal on the table . The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem . Less effective but more ambitious climate policies cost at least 6 per cent of global GDP per year and likely much more . Wind and solar , which covers less than half of one percent of global energy , costs dozens of times more than their climate benefits . Electric cars provide perhaps a thousandth in climate benefit of their substantial public subsidies . Biofuels are just hugely costly while increasing emissions .\n\nWhen we shift the climate conversation to describe positives along with negatives , and focus on costs and benefits of policies – essentially treating this challenge like any other policy agenda – it becomes obvious how many of today ’ s accepted climate policies are poor . Little wonder climate campaigners do not want this sort of conversation .", "label": [[1333, 1562, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [2887, 3051, "Ad Populum"], [3185, 3445, "Ad Populum"], [3772, 4076, "Intentional"], [4387, 4564, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [4658, 4882, "Ad Populum"], [5069, 5181, "Ad Populum"], [5442, 5541, "Ad Populum"], [5184, 5303, "Ad Populum"], [12, 246, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [973, 1013, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [144, 287, "Logical Fallacy"], [469, 531, "Ad Populum"], [1834, 1912, "Faulty Generalization"], [3713, 3875, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [5881, 5952, "Ad Hominem"]], "source_url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/no-one-ever-says-it-but-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-a-go/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-bjorn-lomborg-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-good-thing/"}
{"id": 548, "data": "Australia 's Great Barrier Reef is one of the world 's greatest reservoirs of biodiversity .\n\nA World Heritage site , it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures , which is causing widespread coral bleaching that is damaging and , in some cases , even killing the reefs .\n\nNow a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming , and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected , `` large parts '' of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s .\n\nThe study has not yet been submitted for peer review in a scientific journal . And until this study is reviewed and published in a scientific journal , its results should be treated as preliminary , but consistent with other recent climate science research .\n\nThe study examines what has caused ocean temperatures to spike to record highs in the Coral Sea region , which encompasses much of the Great Barrier Reef , including the hardest-hit northern reaches .\n\n`` This area has recorded a big increase in temperatures over the past century , with March 2016 being the warmest on record , '' the researchers wrote in a piece published at The Conversation on Thursday , a website that publishes academic works .\n\nCoral bleaching occurs when coral expels the algae that lives in its tissue , giving it color and nutrients . This action , caused by stresses such as increased water temperature and pollution , leaves the coral skeleton exposed , making it more susceptible to heat stress , disease and pollution .\n\nThe analysis used methods that have also been used to analyze other extreme weather and climate events , including record heat waves and extreme precipitation events .\n\nThe scientists found that human-caused global warming made the record warm ocean temperatures and related bleaching events seen this year at least 175 times more likely to occur . The analysis found that climate change increased ocean temperatures by 1 degree Celsius , or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit , during March .\n\nThe study projects that this year 's extreme warmth is likely to occur every two years in the month of March by the year 2034 .\n\nThe analysis ' findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die-off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050 , as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems .\n\n“ We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world ’ s greatest natural wonders ”\n\n“ These extreme temperatures will become commonplace by the 2030s putting a great strain on the ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef , ” said lead author Andrew King of the ARC centre of excellence for climate system science , in a statement .\n\n“ We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world ’ s greatest natural wonders , ” he said .\n\nAlthough the study has yet to be peer-reviewed , the methods used to detect the role of climate change in extreme events are becoming more firmly established in the climate science community .\n\n`` We hope to submit a more comprehensive version of this analysis for peer-review soon , '' King told Mashable in an interview .\n\nSuch extreme event attribution studies have been used to detect the influence of human-caused global warming in other extreme temperature events .\n\nFor this study , researchers looked at temperature data and computer model simulations that included only natural factors that alter the climate , compared to simulations that include human emissions of greenhouse gases .\n\nThey found that the simulations that include greenhouse gases best fit the temperature data , and using statistical techniques they calculated the amount of the ocean warming that should be attributed to human-caused global warming , something known as `` fractional attributable risk . ''\n\nIn a blog post , the researchers said that they released the results prior to peer review `` because of the grave nature of their findings and importance of the Great Barrier Reef to all Australians . ''\n\n“ We are confident in the results because these kind of attribution studies are well established , but what we found demands urgent action if we are to preserve the reef , ” King said .\n\n“ For this reason , we felt it was vital to get our findings out as quickly as possible . ”\n\nCoral reefs as the tripwire for `` dangerous interference '' with climate\nThe new analysis adds more evidence for those who argue that global warming may already be causing `` dangerous interference with the climate system . ''\n\nThat vague phrase from a 1992 U.N. climate treaty established what the nations of the world should work to avoid by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide and methane .\n\nThe Paris Agreement on climate change , which 172 countries signed on April 22 , maintains that goal as its ultimate objective , without defining it .\n\nThis new analysis suggests we have already crossed into `` dangerous '' territory .\n\n`` The damage to the reef is a very clear indicator of the harm our greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the planet , '' King said .\n\n`` Hopefully this severe bleaching will help to trigger action so that we can curb our emissions . ''\n\nA strong El Niño climate event , combined with the impact of global warming and other factors , has prompted unusually warm ocean temperatures and the world 's third-ever global coral bleaching event , which began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2017 .\n\nThe bleaching seen in the Coral Sea is part of this event .\n\nHeidi Cullen , the chief scientist for Climate Central in New Jersey who leads a consortium of researchers who conduct extreme event attribution studies , told Mashable that this new analysis `` makes clear the heavy toll of burning fossil fuels . ''\n\n`` It is the ultimate alarm bell that we need to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right away , '' she said .\n\nCullen was not involved in the new study .\n\nThe projection that much of the Great Barrier Reef could perish within the next few decades could turn out to be too pessimistic , since other research has shown that some species of corals are surprisingly resilient to the stress from changing ocean temperatures .\n\nIn a press release on March 29 , the Australian Coral Bleaching Task Force announced that the northern portions of the Great Barrier Reef are in the throes of the most intense coral bleaching event on record there .\n\nThe Task Force , comprised of 10 Australian research institutions , made its determination after completing aerial surveys of more than 500 coral reefs from Cairns north to Papua New Guinea .\n\n“ This has been the saddest research trip of my life , ” says Prof. Terry Hughes , convener of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce , said in a press release .\n\n“ Almost without exception , every reef we flew across showed consistently high levels of bleaching , from the reef slope right up onto the top of the reef , '' Hughes said .\n\n`` We flew for 4,000 kilometers in the most pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef , and saw only four reefs that had no bleaching . The severity is much greater than in earlier bleaching events in 2002 or 1998 . ”\n\nThe ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed , and only the third ever seen . It has occurred during the warmest year on record , which occurred in 2015 , and the two most unusually mild months on Earth , which took place in January and February , respectively .\n\n“ This has been the saddest research trip of my life ”\n\nIt is due to record warm ocean temperatures around the world , partly driven by a strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean .", "label": [[7525, 7575, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://mashable.com/article/great-barrier-reef-perish-2030#:~:text=Climate%20Change-,Great%20Barrier%20Reef%20may%20perish%20by%202030s%20as%20ocean%20temperatures,Great%20Barrier%20Reef%2C%20scientists%20say.&text=Coral%20bleaching%20occurs%20when%20coral,giving%20it%20color%20and%20nutrients.", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-perish-2030s-andrew-freedman-mashable/"}
{"id": 552, "data": "The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity , and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades , scientists reported Monday .\n\nThose emissions , primarily from the burning of fossil fuels , are causing the ocean to rise at the fastest rate since at least the founding of ancient Rome , the scientists said . They added that in the absence of human emissions , the ocean surface would be rising less rapidly and might even be falling .\n\nThe increasingly routine tidal flooding is making life miserable in places like Miami Beach ; Charleston , S.C. ; and Norfolk , Va. , even on sunny days .\n\nThough these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater , they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees , blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains , polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland .\n\nSuch events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage , the new research suggests .\n\n“ I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding , ” said Benjamin H. Strauss , the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday . “ It ’ s not the tide . It ’ s not the wind . It ’ s us . That ’ s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience . ”\n\nIn the second study , scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries , with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely , they found , because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions .\n\nThey also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades , the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100 .\n\nExperts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond , likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities .\n\nThe findings are yet another indication that the stable climate in which human civilization has flourished for thousands of years , with a largely predictable ocean permitting the growth of great coastal cities , is coming to an end .\n\n“ I think we can definitely be confident that sea-level rise is going to continue to accelerate if there ’ s further warming , which inevitably there will be , ” said Stefan Rahmstorf , a professor of ocean physics at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , in Germany , and co-author of one of the papers , published online Monday by an American journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\n\nIn a report issued to accompany that scientific paper , a climate research and communications organization in Princeton , N.J. , Climate Central , used the new findings to calculate that roughly three-quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in towns along the East Coast would not be happening in the absence of the rise in the sea level caused by human emissions .\n\nThe lead author of that report , Dr. Strauss , said the same was likely true on a global scale , in any coastal community that has had an increase of saltwater flooding in recent decades .\n\nThe rise in the sea level contributes only in a limited degree to the huge , disastrous storm surges accompanying hurricanes like Katrina and Sandy . Proportionally , it has a bigger effect on the nuisance floods that can accompany what are known as king tides .\n\nThe change in frequency of those tides is striking . For instance , in the decade from 1955 to 1964 at Annapolis , Md. , an instrument called a tide gauge measured 32 days of flooding ; in the decade from 2005 to 2014 , that jumped to 394 days .\n\nFlood days in Charleston jumped from 34 in the earlier decade to 219 in the more recent , and in Key West , Fla. , the figure jumped from no flood days in the earlier decade to 32 in the more recent .\n\nThe new research was led by Robert E. Kopp , an earth scientist at Rutgers University who has won respect from his colleagues by bringing elaborate statistical techniques to bear on longstanding problems , like understanding the history of the global sea level .\n\nBased on extensive geological evidence , scientists already knew that the sea level rose drastically at the end of the last ice age , by almost 400 feet , causing shorelines to retreat up to a hundred miles in places . They also knew that the sea level had basically stabilized , like the rest of the climate , over the past several thousand years , the period when human civilization arose .\n\nBut there were small variations of climate and sea level over that period , and the new paper is the most exhaustive attempt yet to clarify them .\n\nThe paper shows the ocean to be extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the Earth ’ s temperature . The researchers found that when the average global temperature fell by a third of a degree Fahrenheit in the Middle Ages , for instance , the surface of the ocean dropped by about three inches in 400 years . When the climate warmed slightly , that trend reversed .\n\n“ Physics tells us that sea-level change and temperature change should go hand-in-hand , ” Dr. Kopp said . “ This new geological record confirms it . ”\n\nIn the 19th century , as the Industrial Revolution took hold , the ocean began to rise briskly , climbing about eight inches since 1880 . That sounds small , but it has caused extensive erosion worldwide , costing billions .\n\nDue largely to human emissions , global temperatures have jumped about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century . The sea is rising at what appears to be an accelerating pace , lately reaching a rate of about a foot per century .\n\nOne of the authors of the new paper , Dr. Rahmstorf , had previously published estimates suggesting the sea could rise as much as five or six feet by 2100 . But with the improved calculations from the new paper , his latest upper estimate is three to four feet .\n\nThat means Dr. Rahmstorf ’ s forecast is now more consistent with calculations issued in 2013 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a United Nations body that periodically reviews and summarizes climate research . That body found that continued high emissions might produce a rise in the sea of 1.7 to 3.2 feet over the 21st century .\n\nIn an interview , Dr. Rahmstorf said the rise would eventually reach five feet and far more — the only question was how long it would take . Scientists say the recent climate agreement negotiated in Paris is not remotely ambitious enough to forestall a significant melting of Greenland and Antarctica , though if fully implemented , it may slow the pace somewhat .\n\n“ Ice simply melts faster when the temperatures get higher , ” Dr. Rahmstorf said . “ That ’ s just basic physics . ”", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/science/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change/"}
{"id": 553, "data": "An East Coast blizzard howling , global temperatures peaking , the desert Southwest flooding , drought-stricken California drying up—surely there ’ s a common thread tying together this “ extreme ” weather . There is . But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever . It is called business as usual .\n\nSurface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly : They ’ ve been going up , in fits and starts , for more than 150 years , or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age . Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up , temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II . They then cooled down a bit , only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’ 90s , about the same amount as earlier in the century .\n\nWhether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at . Until last June , most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s , and since then had plateaued in a “ hiatus. ” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature .\n\nThat changed last summer , when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) decided to overhaul its data , throwing out satellite-sensed sea-surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on , among other sources , readings taken from the cooling-water-intake tubes of oceangoing vessels . The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship ’ s infrastructure conducts heat , absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun ’ s energy , and vessels ’ intake tubes are at different ocean depths . See , for instance , John J. Kennedy ’ s “ A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature , ” published Jan. 24 , 2014 , by the journal Reviews of Geophysics .\n\nNOAA ’ s alteration of its measurement standard and other changes produced a result that could have been predicted : a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years , erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain .

{"id": 554, "data": "Forget what global warming activists would lead you to believe – 2015 was not even close to the hottest year on record .\n\nSatellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era , followed by 2010 . 2015 comes in third . And these results are only for the period since 1979 .\n\n2015 should have been warmer . This past year saw what is likely the most powerful El Nino during the satellite temperature record . With a record El Nino , we should have experienced record high temperatures . Yet we didn ’ t .\n\nA record El Nino resulting in less-than-record temperatures is another sign that global warming is not all that activists crack it up to be . Indeed , if a record strong El Nino can not bring global temperatures back to the warmth of 1998 , what can – and when will that be ? 18 years after 1998 , global warming still has not created the runaway warming we were told to expect .\n\nOf course , it is not too difficult for activists to paint a picture of an exceptionally warm world – record El Nino or not – when they conveniently define “ the record ” as merely extending back to the late 1800s . Global warming activists do not extend “ the record ” back any further , they say , because it has only been since the late 1800s that we have had a global network of mercury thermometers . But we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s , and the evidence shows temperatures have been warmer than today for most of the past several thousand years , including warmer-than-present temperatures for most of the human civilization time period .\n\nScientists measuring oxygen isotopes from ice cores drilled in Greenland and Antarctica ( among other methods ) report that temperatures were significantly warmer than today for most of the past 10,000 years . With the exception of the Little Ice Age , which lasted from approximately 1300-1850 and which almost ushered in a full-blown new ice age epoch , current temperatures remain cooler than almost all other time periods in human history .\n\nSo how do global warming activists get away with raising constant alarm and making such outrageous claims as 2015 being the hottest ever ? The answer is misleading head-fakes , doctored temperature records , and a compliant media that is more than willing to push the agenda of global warming activists .\n\nNo , Virginia , 2015 was not the hottest year on record . In fact , it wasn ’ t even close .\n\nUpdate Jan. 25 , 2016 : As I predicted in this article , global warming activists have indeed made a full-blown public relations effort to claim 2015 was the warmest year on record . This calls for a little more discussion of the relative reliability of satellite temperature measurements , surface temperature measurements , and adjusted surface temperature measurements .\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) instruments aboard NASA satellites use microwave frequencies to measure the radiance of the Earth . Scientists then apply objective mathematical formulas to produce precise temperature measurements from the radiance data . For temperature readings , the measurements focus on readings at approximately 10,000 feet ( about two miles ) above the Earth ’ s surface , where physics tell us the warming impacts of accumulating carbon dioxide should be moderately stronger than at the Earth ’ s surface . In other words , the satellite data is objective , precise , and should report moderately more warming than at the Earth ’ s surface .\n\nBy contrast , temperature measurements at the Earth ’ s surface are less reliable . Temperature stations are not uniformly distributed like the atmospheric sampling of satellite instruments . Population growth and the effects of creeping urbanization create urban heat islands of local warmth that have nothing to do with greenhouse gases or global warming . Changes in land use at or near surface temperature stations also impact temperature readings . For these and other reasons , surface temperature readings lack the precision and consistent quality of satellite temperature data .\n\nWe do , however , have some means of attempting to pull accurate temperature data from surface temperature stations . For example , some surface temperature stations are located at sites better insulated from artificial temperature signals and are better maintained than others . Data from these surface temperature stations should be afforded more confidence than data from more suspect locations and stations .\n\nAs I recently reported at Forbes.com , a study presented last month at the American Geophysical Union found that well-sited and well-maintained stations report significantly less warming than the surface station network as a whole .\n\nGovernment overseers collect the raw temperature data from the full network of surface stations and then produce temperature summaries for public distribution . One would expect that the government overseers would simply report the raw data that was collected . In the alternative , one might expect the government overseers to adjust the recent temperature data downward to reflect the false warming signal of creeping urbanization and the studies showing uncorrupted surface temperature stations report less warming than the full network of corrupted and uncorrupted temperature stations . Instead , and remarkably , government overseers adjust the data to add more recent warming than is being reported in the raw temperature readings . Only after government overseers make these highly suspect adjustments are temperature “ records ” capable of showing anything approaching record warmth .\n\nUltimately , we must decide on a hierarchy of accuracy and reliability for temperature “ reports. ” The most objective and scientifically justifiable current hierarchy is , in order , ( 1 ) satellite readings ( 2 ) raw , unadjusted surface readings culled solely from the best-maintained surface stations ( 3 ) raw surface temperature readings from the network as a whole , adjusted downward in recent years to reflect creeping urbanization ( 4 ) raw , unadjusted surface temperature readings from the network as a whole and ( 5 ) surface temperature readings adjusted upward in recent years in defiance of common sense and objective scientific studies .\n\nGlobal warming activists choose the fifth option as a means to make “ record warmth ” claims . Scientific integrity argues strongly against that .", "label": [[0, 118, "Logical Fallacy"], [836, 937, "Ad Populum"], [4585, 4776, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [0, 118, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [560, 699, "False Causality"], [463, 558, "Faulty Generalization"], [1157, 1345, "Faulty Generalization"], [2534, 2657, "Ad Hominem"], [5372, 5517, "Faulty Generalization"], [5520, 5671, "Ad Hominem"]], "source_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2016/01/14/2015-was-not-even-close-to-hottest-year-on-record/?sh=7170b4ef5539", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/james-taylor-2015-was-not-even-close-to-hottest-year-on-record/"}
{"id": 558, "data": "Global warming alarmists frequently make false and deplorable assertions ( see , for example , my recent column debunking false claims that global warming is causing a decline in wheat production ) , but the Environmental Defense Fund ’ s recent fund-raising mailer , “ 10 Global Warming Effects That May Shock You , ” may well set a new low . However , climate realists can make lemonade from EDF ’ s preposterous mailer by using it to show open-minded people the difference between global warming alarmists and global warming truth-tellers .\n\nEDF has assembled what it believes to be the 10 most powerful global warming assertions in the alarmists ’ playbook , yet each assertion either backfires on alarmists or has been proven false . While reading how flawed EDF ’ s assertions are , remember these are the very best arguments global warming alarmists can make . Open-minded readers should have very little difficulty dismissing the mythical global warming crisis after examining the top 10 assertions in the alarmist playbook .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 1\n\n“ Bats Drop from the Sky – In 2014 , a scorching summer heat wave caused more than 100,000 bats to literally drop dead and fall from the sky in Queensland , Australia . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nGlobal warming alarmists ’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year ( to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year ) in the United States alone . This appalling death toll occurs every year even while wind power produces just 3 % of U.S. electricity . Ramping up wind power to 10 , 20 , or 30 % of U.S. electricity production would likely increase annual bat kills to 10-to-30 million every year . Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense .\n\nJust as importantly , alarmists present no evidence that global warming caused the summer heat wave in a notoriously hot desert near the equator . To the contrary , climate change theory and objective data show our recent global warming is occurring primarily in the winter , toward the poles , and at night .\n\nAustralia ’ s highest recorded temperature occurred more than half a century ago , and only two of Australia ’ s seven states have set their all-time temperature record during the past 40 years . Indeed , Queensland ’ s 2014 heat wave paled in comparison to the 1972 heat wave that occurred 42 years of global warming ago . If global warming caused the 2014 Queensland heat wave , why wasn ’ t it as severe as the 1972 Queensland heat wave ? Blaming every single summer heat wave or extreme weather event on global warming is a stale and discredited tactic in the alarmist playbook . Objective science proves extreme weather events such as hurricanes , tornadoes , heat waves , and droughts have become less frequent and less severe as a result of the Earth ’ s recent modest warming .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 2\n\n“ Lyme Disease Spreads ” – Warmer temperatures are contributing to the range expansion and severity of tick-borne Lyme disease . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nLyme Disease is much more common in northern , cooler regions of the United States than in southern , warmer regions . Asserting , without any supporting data or evidence , that a disease that prospers in cool climates will become more prevalent as a result of global warming defies objective data and common sense . Moreover , a team of scientists extensively researched Lyme Disease climate and habitat and reported in the peer-reviewed science journal EcoHealth , “ the only environmental variable consistently association with increased [ Lyme Disease ] risk and incidence was the presence of forests . ”\n\nGranted , alarmists can argue that forests are thriving under global warming , with the result that forest-dwelling ticks will also benefit . However , expanding forests are universally – and properly – viewed as environmentally beneficial . Alarmist attempts to frame thriving forests as harmful perfectly illustrate the alarmists ’ proclivity to claim anything and everything – no matter how beneficial – is severely harmful and caused by global warming .\n\nMoreover , even if global warming expanded Lyme Disease range , one must look at the totality of global warming ’ s impact on the range of viruses and diseases . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports Lyme Disease “ is rare as a cause of death in the United States. ” According to the CDC , Lyme Disease is a contributing factor to less than 25 deaths per year in the United States . Indeed , during a recent five-year span examined by the CDC , “ only 1 [ death ] record was consistent with clinical manifestations of Lyme Disease. ” Any attempts to claim global warming will cause a few more Lyme Disease deaths must be weighed against the 36,000 Americans who are killed by the flu each year . The U.S. National Institutes of Health have documented how influenza is aided and abetted by cold climate . Any attempt to connect a warmer climate to an increase in Lyme Disease must be accompanied by an acknowledgement of a warmer climate ’ s propensity to reduce influenza incidence and mortality . The net impact of a warmer climate on viruses and diseases such as Lyme Disease and influenza is substantially beneficial and life-saving .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 3\n\n“ National Security Threatened – The impacts of climate change are expected to act as a ‘ threat multiplier ’ in many of the world ’ s most unstable regions , exacerbating droughts and other natural disasters as well as leading to food , water and other resource shortages that may spur mass migrations . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe alarmists ’ asserted national security threat depends on assertions that ( 1 ) global warming is causing a reduction in food and water supplies and ( 2 ) migrations of people to places with more food and water will increase risks of military conflict . Objective facts refute both assertions .\n\nRegarding food and water supplies , global crop production has soared as the Earth gradually warms . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is essential to plant life , and adding more of it to the atmosphere enhances plant growth and crop production . Longer growing seasons and fewer frost events also benefit plant growth and crop production . As this column has repeatedly documented ( see articles here , here , and here , for example ) , global crops set new production records virtually every year as our planet modestly warms . If crop shortages cause national security threats and global warming increases crop production , then global warming benefits rather than jeopardizes national security .\n\nThe same holds true for water supplies . Objective data show there has been a gradual increase in global precipitation and soil moisture as our planet warms . Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans , which in turn stimulates more frequent precipitation over continental land masses . The result of this enhanced precipitation is an improvement in soil moisture at almost all sites in the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank . If declining precipitation and declining soil moisture are military threat multipliers , than global warming is creating a safer , more peaceful world .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 4\n\n“ Sea Levels Rising – Warmer temperatures are causing glaciers and polar ice sheets to melt , increasing the amount of water in the world ’ s seas and oceans . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe pace of sea level rise remained relatively constant throughout the 20th century , even as global temperatures gradually rose . There has similarly been no increase in the pace of sea level rise in recent decades . Utilizing 20th century technologies , humans effectively adapted to global sea level rise . Utilizing 21st century technologies , humans will be even better equipped to adapt to global sea level rise .\n\nAlso , the alarmist assertion that polar ice sheets are melting is simply false . Although alarmists frequently point to a modest recent shrinkage in the Arctic ice sheet , that decline has been completely offset by ice sheet expansion in the Antarctic . Cumulatively , polar ice sheets have not declined at all since NASA satellite instruments began precisely measuring them 35 years ago .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 5\n\n“ Allergies Worsen – Allergy sufferers beware : Climate change could cause pollen counts to double in the next 30 years . The warming temperatures cause advancing weed growth , a bane for allergy sufferers . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nPollen is a product and mechanism of plant reproduction and growth . As such , pollen counts will rise and fall along with plant health and vegetation intensity . Any increase in pollen will be the result of a greener biosphere with more plant growth . Similar to the alarmist argument , discussed above , that expanding forests will create more habitat for the ticks that spread Lyme Disease , alarmists here are taking overwhelmingly good news about global warming improving plant health and making it seem like this good news is actually bad news because healthier plants mean more pollen .\n\nIndeed , NASA satellite instruments have documented a spectacular greening of the Earth , with foliage gains most prevalent in previously arid , semi-desert regions . For people experiencing an increase in vegetation in previously barren regions , this greening of the Earth is welcome and wonderful news . For global warming alarmists , however , a greener biosphere is terrible news and something to be opposed . This , in a nutshell , defines the opposing sides in the global warming debate . Global warming alarmists claim a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is horrible and justifies massive , economy-destroying energy restrictions . Global warming realists understand that a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is not a horrible thing simply because humans may have had some role in creating it .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 6\n\n“ Beetles Destroy Iconic Western Forests – Climate change has sent tree-killing beetles called mountain pine beetles into overdrive . Under normal conditions those beetles reproduce just once annually , but the warming climate has allowed them to churn out an extra generation of new bugs each year . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nAlarmists claim warmer winters are causing an increase in pine beetle populations . This assertion is thoroughly debunked by objective , real-world data .\n\nAs an initial matter , alarmists have responded to recent bitterly cold winters by claiming global warming is causing colder winters . One can not claim global warming is causing colder winters and then turn around and simultaneously claim global warming is causing warmer winters . Global warming activists ’ propensity for doing so shows just how little value they place in a truthful debate .\n\nObjective scientific data verify winters are getting colder , which counters the key prerequisite to EDF ’ s pine beetle claim . NOAA temperature data show winter temperatures in the United States have been getting colder for at least the past two decades . Pine beetles can not be taking advantage of warmer winters if winters are in fact getting colder . Moreover , recent U.S. Forest Service data show pine beetle infestations have recently declined dramatically throughout the western United States .\n\nForests and plant life are expanding globally , and particularly in the western United States . Pine beetles are a natural part of forest ecosystems . Expanding pine forests can support more beetles . The predictable increase in pine beetles is largely a product of , rather than a foil against , expanding pine forests . One can hardly argue that western pine forests are “ destroying iconic Western forests ” when western forests are becoming denser and more prevalent as the planet warms .\n\nAlso , beetles have bored through North American forests for millennia , long before people built coal-fired power plants and drove SUVs . Beetles are not dependent on warm winters , as evidenced by their historic prevalence in places such as Alaska .\n\nFinally , pine beetles tend to target dead , unhealthy , more vulnerable pine trees rather than healthy trees . Decades of over-aggressive fire suppression policies have caused an unnatural buildup of older , denser , more vulnerable pine forests . These conditions predictably aid pine beetles .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 7\n\n“ Canada : The New America – ‘ Lusher ’ vegetation growth typically associated with the United States is now becoming more common in Canada , scientists reported in a 2012 Nature Climate Change study . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nOnly global warming alarmists would claim that lusher vegetation and more abundant plant life is a bad thing . Playing on a general tendency for people to fear change , EDF and global warming alarmists argue that changes in the biosphere that make it richer , lusher , and more conducive to life are changes to be feared and opposed . If barren ecosystems constitute an ideal planet , then the alarmist fears of more plant life make sense . On the contrary , global warming realists understand a climate more conducive to richer , more abundant plant life is beneficial rather than harmful .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 8\n\n“ Economic Consequences – The costs associated with climate change rise along with the temperatures . Severe storms and floods combined with agricultural losses cause billions of dollars in damages , and money is needed to treat and control the spread of disease ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nSevere storms , floods and agricultural losses may cost a great deal of money , but such extreme weather events – and their resulting costs – are dramatically declining as the Earth modestly warms . Accordingly , EDF ’ s asserted economic costs are actually economic benefits .\n\nAs documented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and here at Forbes.com , severe storms are becoming less frequent and severe as the Earth modestly warms . This is especially evident regarding hurricane and tornado activity , which are both at historic lows . Similarly , scientific measurements and peer-reviewed studies report no increase in flooding events regarding natural-flowing rivers and streams . Any increase in flooding activity is due to human alterations of river and stream flow rather than precipitation changes .\n\nAlso , the modest recent warming is producing U.S. and global crop production records virtually every year , creating billions of dollars in new economic and human welfare benefits each and every year . This creates a net economic benefit completely ignored by EDF .\n\nRegarding “ the spread of disease , ” as documented in “ Alarmist Assertion # 2 , ” objective evidence shows global warming will thwart deadly outbreaks of influenza and other cold-dependent viruses .\n\nAdditionally , the alarmists ’ desired means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions – more expensive energy sources – make economic conditions even worse . Forcing the American economy to operate on expensive and unreliable wind and solar power will have tremendous negative economic consequences . President Obama acknowledged this fact when he promised that under his global warming plan , “ electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. ” The economic consequences of Obama ’ s global warming policies can already be seen in electricity prices , which are currently the highest in U.S. history . Remarkably , Obama ’ s global warming policies are increasing electricity prices even while new natural gas discoveries , revolutionary advances in natural gas production technologies , and a dramatic resultant decline in natural gas prices would otherwise spur a dramatic decline in electricity prices .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 9\n\n“ Infectious Diseases Thrive – The World Health Organization reports that outbreaks of new or resurgent diseases are on the rise and in more disparate countries than ever before , including tropical illnesses in once cold climates . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nOutbreaks of “ new or resurgent diseases ” are occurring precisely because governments have caved in to environmental activist groups like EDF and implemented their anti-science agendas . For example , DDT had all but eliminated malaria in the United States and on the global stage during the mid-20th century . However , environmental activists championed false environmental accusations against DDT and dramatically reduced use of the life-saving mosquito killer throughout much of the world . As a result , malaria has reemerged with a vengeance and millions of people die every year as a result .\n\nAlso , as documented above in “ Alarmist Assertion # 2 , ” global warming will reduce the impact and death toll of cold-related viruses such as influenza . In the United States alone , influenza kills 36,000 people every year , which dwarfs all heat-dependent viruses and diseases combined . Few people other than global warming alarmists would argue that it is better to have 36,000 people die each year from influenza than have a few people die each year from Lyme Disease ( which , as documented above , isn ’ t even related to global warming ) .\n\nAlarmist Assertion # 10\n\n“ Shrinking Glaciers – In 2013 , an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago broke off the Pine Island Glacier , the most important glacier of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet . And at Montana ’ s Glacier National Park glaciers have gone from 150 to just 35 over the past century . ”\n\nThe Facts\n\nCalling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet , while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet , is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists . Icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet every year , with or without global warming , particularly in the Antarctic summer . However , a particular iceberg – no matter how large – breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet does not necessarily result in “ Shrinking Glaciers ” as EDF alleges . To the contrary , the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been growing at a steady and substantial pace ever since NASA satellites first began measuring the Antarctic ice sheet in 1979 . Indeed , during the same year that the EDF claims “ an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago ” broke off the Antarctic ice sheet and caused “ Shrinking Glaciers , ” the Antarctic ice sheet repeatedly set new records for its largest extent in recorded history . Those 2013 records were repeatedly broken again in 2014 . The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history , and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking .\n\nThe EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs . Moreover , opening up more of the Earth ’ s surface to vegetation and plant and animal life would normally be considered a beneficial change , if global warming alarmists had not so thoroughly politicized the global warming discussion .\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThere you have it . These are the 10 best arguments global warming activists like EDF can make , along with the objective scientific facts that prove them wrong .\n\nNo wonder global warming alarmists are so terrified of people having access to both sides of the debate .", "label": [[0, 72, "Ad Hominem"], [868, 1031, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [739, 865, "Ad Hominem"], [1242, 1351, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [1555, 1698, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1701, 1846, "Logical Fallacy"], [3234, 3429, "False Dilemma"], [4748, 4908, "Equivocation"], [7902, 7981, "Ad Hominem"], [2485, 2602, "False Causality"], [9302, 9440, "Faulty Generalization"], [9631, 9798, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [10618, 10763, "False Dilemma"], [10766, 10876, "Ad Hominem"], [14395, 14659, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [16040, 16225, "False Causality"], [11708, 11877, "Logical Fallacy"], [12840, 13003, "False Dilemma"], [4910, 5351, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [5018, 5210, "False Dilemma"], [0, 197, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [354, 541, "Ad Hominem"], [739, 865, "Intentional"], [1242, 1492, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [1555, 1698, "Faulty Generalization"], [1701, 1846, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [1850, 2157, "Intentional"], [2366, 2602, "Intentional"], [2603, 2742, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3967, 4180, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [4748, 4907, "Faulty Generalization"], [5696, 5991, "Logical Fallacy"], [6236, 6686, "Faulty Generalization"], [6731, 7278, "Faulty Generalization"], [7699, 7898, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [7984, 8290, "Equivocation"], [8619, 8790, "Intentional"], [9302, 9547, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [9631, 9797, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [9800, 9984, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [10880, 11234, "Intentional"], [11482, 11705, "False Causality"], [11708, 11876, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [12245, 12427, "False Causality"], [12671, 12779, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [12782, 13003, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [13006, 13260, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [13654, 13840, "Intentional"], [14271, 14391, "False Causality"], [14402, 14595, "False Causality"], [15019, 15159, "Faulty Generalization"], [15306, 15460, "Intentional"], [15476, 15765, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [16242, 16638, "False Causality"], [16798, 16931, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [16934, 17116, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [17509, 17740, "Ad Hominem"], [18702, 19101, "Intentional"], [19115, 19338, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [19537, 19640, "Intentional"], [17509, 17740, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"]], "source_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/02/09/top-10-global-warming-lies-that-may-shock-you/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/forbes-james-taylor-top-10-global-warming-lies-that-may-shock-you/"}

{"id": 560, "data": "Hurricane Patricia , which is threatening the coast of western Mexico with a catastrophic impact , intensified at rates that were among the fastest scientists have seen anywhere on Earth . The storm went from 60 mph winds to 200 mph in just 30 hours . By early Friday morning , the storm was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in either the eastern Pacific or entire North Atlantic basin , which also includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean . It 's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near-record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms . It 's also an area where atmospheric conditions were favorable for such a storm to strengthen . [ seealso url= '' http : //mashable.com/2015/10/23/hurricane-patricia-mexico/ '' ] Consider this : As of 5 a.m . ET on Thursday , the storm had 85 mile-per-hour winds and a minimum central air pressure of 980 millibars . By 5 a.m . ET on Friday , the winds increased to 200 miles per hour , with an air pressure of 880 millibars . That 's an astonishing 100 millibar drop in air pressure in a 24-hour period , which is virtually unheard of . The intensification rate looked like a steep staircase when graphed using a satellite-based computer algorithm that tracks storm intensity .\n\nA period of rapid intensification was forecast by most hurricane prediction models , though none foresaw the sheer ferocity that the storm would eventually achieve .\n\nWhile scientists have made great strides in recent years in understanding what factors cause hurricanes and typhoons to rapidly intensify , there remain some mysteries about this process . Based on email conversations Mashable had with a half dozen tropical cyclone experts on Friday morning , here 's what we know so far .\n\nWarm water served as fuel\nThe storm exploded over an area of exceptional ocean warmth , with waters of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year . In addition , the atmospheric conditions in this area were ideally suited for a rapidly strengthening storm , with what is known as `` thermodynamic potential intensity '' readings at a maximum . This occurred right in the area where Patricia spun its way into the record books on Friday morning . The ocean warmth is largely due to a near-record strong El Niño event , which has not only raised ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific , but has also caused those warm waters to extend deeper below the surface than is usually the case , which also helps storms to intensify .\n\nIn addition , most of the storms that have formed so far this year -- and there have been a record number in the eastern tropical Pacific -- have formed well west of where Patricia spun up . These left plenty of undisturbed warm water , which is fuel for a storm like this . `` Basically that area closer to Mexico usually has a lot more tropical cyclones nearby , '' said Eric Blake , a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami . `` Since they were all much farther west , Patricia ended up moving over very warm , untapped waters with the rest of the conditions quite ripe . ''\n\nCooperative atmosphere\nRyan Maue , a meteorologist for the private weather firm WeatherBell Analytics , said `` alarm bells '' were ringing on Thursday based on computer model indications that the storm would intensify quickly .\n\nThese signals showed an `` optimal/perfect atmosphere and ocean conditions for explosive intensification , '' Maue wrote . He said the fact that Patricia is a small storm , with a compact inner core of intense thunderstorms , helped it to `` deepen pressure within a tiny radius of maximum wind . '' ( The storm is smaller , in area , than Super Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Katrina . ) Maue also noted that the ocean temperatures the storm is tapping into are the warmest left in the entire northern hemisphere at this date , at about 31 degrees Celsius , or 88 degrees Fahrenheit . But is this intensification rate an indication of how global warming is altering the characteristics and behavior of nature 's most powerful storms ? That 's a harder question to answer at this point , scientists told Mashable .\n\nKerry Emanuel , a hurricane expert at MIT , said the lack of a consistent record of eastern Pacific storms using hurricane hunter flights makes it difficult to determine if there is a global warming-related trend in such storms . Such flights are typically flown in the Atlantic and only occasionally in the eastern Pacific , so this was an exceptional case . `` There is no question that this is an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone , '' he wrote . `` But I wonder whether we really know that prior storms in the region have not been equally intense and we are just lucky to have measured this one . ''\n\nGlobal warming considerations\nMaue , for his part , said hurricanes tend to respond to more localized conditions when intensifying or weakening , rather than global trends . `` Hurricanes respond locally , and rapid/explosive intensification changes due to climate change could be a result but hard to say with just one storm during a strong El Niño , '' he wrote . Kevin Trenberth , a senior climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , said the unusually mild ocean temperatures are allowing more moisture to flow into the storm , which adds fuel to the fire . Trenberth 's research has shown that global warming has increased the available water vapor for storms around the world , which plays a role in everything from more intense local downpours to hurricanes . `` The moisture flowing into the storm , that provides its primary fuel , must be higher than it has ever been before , '' he wrote . `` It still requires the right setup to convert that into an intense storm , but the environment is surely ripe . That consists , of course , of a substantial El Niño-related component , but also the background global warming that has a memory through the ocean heat content . '' According to Trenberth , El Niño has redistributed ocean heat across the tropical Pacific , putting a bullseye of heat right underneath Hurricane Patricia . `` This is the warmest large-scale spot in the hemisphere , '' Trenberth said . This causes moisture to rush toward that area from relatively cooler ocean waters around it . Sea levels off the coast of Mexico are about 8 inches above average because of the warm bulge of water ( water expands as it is heated ) . `` The subsurface ocean is exceptionally warm as well as the sea surface , '' he said . It 's not just El Niño that 's boosting ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific , either . Other natural climate cycles are contributing too , according to hurricane researcher Gabriel Vecchi of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton , New Jersey . `` To answer which factors was dominant , and by how much , would take a systematic analysis -- so I do n't think I 'm willing to shoot for the hip to tell you which ones are important this year , much less for this particular storm , '' he said . `` But it 's my opinion that there will be time , and there are ways , to assess the impacts of these factors in the future . '' According to Vecchi , projections do show that global warming will increase ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific , which could bring more hurricanes like this one . Tom Knutson , who works in Princeton with Vecchi , told Mashable that a new study shows that the northeast Pacific basin , where Hurricane Patricia is located , will have the largest future increase in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms of anywhere on Earth , which he says is `` probably just a coincidence . '' He said computer modeling studies that he and his colleagues have published show that manmade warming will increase storm intensities in the future , and that this trend may already have begun to a `` small '' extent in the northeast Pacific . Knutson cautioned that observations of northeast Pacific storms do not show such a trend yet , at least for the period from 1982 to 2009 .", "label": [[451, 608, "False Causality"]], "source_url": "https://mashable.com/archive/hurricane-patricia-global-warming", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/andrew-freedman-mashable-hurricane-patricia-global-warming/"}
{"id": 564, "data": "The U.S. government is at it again , hyping meaningless records in a parameter that does not exist in order to frighten us about something that doesn ’ t matter .\n\nNASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) announced this week that according to their calculations , July 2015 was the hottest month since instrumental records began in 1880 . NOAA says that the record was set by eight one-hundredths of a degree Celsius over that set in July 1998 . NASA calculates that July 2015 beat what they assert was the previous warmest month ( July 2011 ) by two one-hundredths of a degree .\n\nBut government spokespeople rarely mention the inconvenient fact that these records are being set by less than the uncertainty in the statistics . NOAA claims an uncertainty of 14 one-hundredths of a degree in its temperature averages , or near twice the amount by which they say the record was set . NASA says that their data is typically accurate to one tenth of a degree , five times the amount by which their new record was set .\n\nSo , the new temperature records are meaningless . Neither agency knows whether a record was set .\n\nSuch misrepresentations are now commonplace in NOAA and NASA announcements . They are regularly proclaiming monthly and yearly records set by less than the uncertainties in the measurements . Scientists within the agencies know that this is dishonest .\n\nThey also know that calculating so-called global average temperatures to hundredths of a degree is irrational . After all , there is very little data for the 70 percent of Earth ’ s surface that is ocean . There is also little data for mountainous and desert regions , not to mention the Antarctic . Much of the coverage is so sparse that NASA is forced to make the ridiculous claim that regions are adequately covered if there is a temperature-sensing station within nearly 750 miles . This is the distance between Ottawa , Canada , and Myrtle Beach , S.C. cities with very different climates . Yet , according to NASA , only one temperature sensing station is necessary for the two cities and the vast area between them to be adequately represented in their network .\n\nIn the final analysis , it is no more meaningful to calculate an average temperature for a whole planet than it is to calculate the average telephone number in the Washington D.C. phone book . Temperature , like viscosity and density , and of course phone numbers , is not something that can be meaningfully averaged . “ Global temperature ” does not exist .\n\nIn their award winning book , “ Taken By Storm ” ( 2007 ) , Canadian researchers Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick explain : “ Temperature is not an amount of something [ like height or weight ] . It is a number that represents the condition of a physical system . In thermodynamics it is known as an intensive quantity , in contrast to quantities like energy , which have an additive property , which we call extensive in thermodynamics . ”\n\nEven if enough accurate surface temperature measurements existed to ensure reasonable planetary coverage ( it doesn ’ t ) and to calculate some sort of global temperature statistic , interpreting its significance would be challenging . What averaging rule would you use to handle the data from thousands of temperature-sensing stations ? Mean , mode , median , root mean square ? Science does not tell us . For some groups of close temperature measures ( and NASA and NOAA are dealing with thousands of very close temperatures ) , one method of calculating an average can lead to a determination of warming while another can lead to a conclusion of cooling .\n\nEven if you could calculate some sort of meaningful global temperature statistic , the figure would be unimportant . No one and nothing would experience it directly since we all live in regions , not the globe . There is no super-sized being straddling the planet , feeling global averages in temperature . Global warming does not matter .\n\nFuture generations are bound to ask why America closed its coal-fueled generating stations , its cheapest , most plentiful source of electric power , and wasted billions of dollars trying to stop insignificant changes in imaginary phenomena .\n\nThe sad answer will be that it had nothing to do with the realities of science , technology or economics . The tragic blunder is based on satisfying political expedience for a privileged few , egged on by vested financial interests , and supported by largely uninformed activists granted the media platforms needed to sway public opinion . As Jay Lehr , science director of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute said , “ It is a scam that dwarfs all others that have come before . ”\n\n• Tom Harris is executive director of the Ottawa , Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition .", "label": [[0, 160, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [757, 908, "Ad Populum"], [1145, 1334, "Intentional"], [2363, 2526, "Intentional"], [3848, 3973, "Fallacy of Relevance (red herring)"], [3977, 4217, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [4561, 4703, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [0, 161, "Intentional"], [1045, 1094, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [2194, 2360, "Fallacy of Extension (straw man)"], [3753, 3845, "Equivocation"], [3977, 4218, "Fallacy of Emotion"], [2976, 3210, "Circular Reasoning"], [3383, 3633, "Equivocation"]], "source_url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/23/tom-harris-global-warming-deceptive-temperature-re/", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/tom-harris-deceptive-temperature-record-claims/"}
{"id": 565, "data": "Over the past year , scientists have been keeping a close eye on an important swath of the Pacific Ocean , just along the equator . When conditions here get just right , an El Niño can form — wreaking havoc on weather patterns across the globe .\n\nThe El Niño currently brewing in the Pacific is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever recorded . This phenomenon is expected to peak before January , with far-reaching impacts all winter and spring . Based on past experience , El Niño could potentially bring much-needed rain to California , but also drought in Australia , destructive floods in Peru , and so on . El Niño has already helped make 2015 the hottest year on record — and might well do the same for 2016 .\n\nThat said , El Niño events are often unpredictable and full of surprises . So what follows is a guide to how El Niño works , what we know about the 2015 event , and how a potentially massive El Niño could upend the world 's weather over the coming months .\n\nA very basic definition of El Niño\nEl Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years . When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken , sea surface temperatures start rising , setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts .\nEl Niños can be strong or weak . Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world , typically making certain regions wetter ( Peru or California , say ) and others drier ( Southeast Asia ) . Some countries suffer major damage as a result .\nEl Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface . When combined with global warming , that can lead to record hot years , as in 1998 .\n`` El Niño '' got its name in the 1800s from Peruvian fisherman , who first noticed a mysterious warm current that would appear around Christmas . They called it the `` little boy '' or `` Christ child . ''\nWhy this year 's El Niño is a huge deal\nThe last truly massive El Niño appeared in 1997-'98 and ended up causing an estimated $ 35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths around the world . ( It also inspired that famous Chris Farley sketch . ) Now we 're facing a similarly massive event : That , in itself , is a surprise . Back in March , NOAA 's Climate Prediction Center announced that a weak El Niño had formed in the Pacific , but many experts initially thought it might fizzle out by summer . Instead , this El Niño kept strengthening , with ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific continuing to soar . By mid-November , temperatures in one critical part of the ocean , the Niño 3.4 region , were running even hotter than they were in 1997 :\n\n`` Right now we say we think it 's really going to be one of the three strongest ones , '' said Michel Jarraud , the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization , who compared it with the 1997-98 , 1982-83 , and 1972-73 El Niño events . `` It may be one of the two ; that we do n't know yet . But definitely it 's already a very strong one . ''\n\nCountries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring . El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia , enabling massive man-made peatland fires to rage out of control , creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore . Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event , harming reefs around the world .\n\nAnd El Niño may just be getting started : In the past , major events have brought unusually hot , dry weather to Australia that can cramp wheat yields and amp up wildfires . It can bring hotter , drier weather to India that hurts agriculture . It can bring heavy rain and destructive flooding to Peru , washing away houses and spreading cholera .\n\nThat said , El Niño is n't all bad . In the United States , it could bring some needed rain this winter to ease California 's drought ( though also deadly mudslides and flooding ) . Historically , El Niño has also served up milder US winters and tamped down on Atlantic hurricanes .\n\nOne important caveat , however , is that every El Niño unfolds a bit differently — and some have unexpected impacts . As NOAA 's Emily Becker points out , strong El Niño events usually bring rain to California in the winter ( as in 1982-'83 ) , but occasionally they do n't ( as in 1965-'66 ) :\n\nAnother key story to watch is how a strong El Niño might push up temperatures worldwide . Global average temperatures are already going up over time , thanks to all the carbon dioxide we 're adding to the atmosphere . According to NASA , 2014 was the hottest year on record . But there was no El Niño that year — and El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average , as heat gets transferred from the ocean to the surface .\n\nThe combination of El Niño and rising CO2 is already helping 2015 shatter heat records . The big question now is whether it 'll do the same for 2016 :\n\nBottom line : There are still a lot of question marks about how this will unfold . But El Niño could well be the biggest weather story of the next several months , with ripple effects around the globe .\n\nHow El Niño actually works , step by step\nTo see how El Niño works , it helps to understand what the equatorial Pacific looks like under normal , or `` neutral , '' conditions :\n\n1 ) Neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean\nNormally , the tropical Pacific features strong trade winds that blow warm ocean water from east to west , where it piles up near Indonesia . Meanwhile , back east along South America , frigid water deep down in the ocean gets pulled up closer to the surface , cooling the area around Peru . Here 's a diagram :\n\nAs a result , during `` neutral '' conditions , sea levels are about half a meter higher near Indonesia than they are in Peru . And the surface water near Indonesia is about 8°C warmer ( 14.4°F ) than it is near Peru . That temperature difference creates a convective loop in the atmosphere that , in turn , reinforces the trade winds .\n\nThis ends up affecting a lot more than just this stretch of ocean . Because the Pacific is so vast , this system is a major driving force in the global climate . The large , warm pool of water near Indonesia causes the air above it to rise , creating rainfall in the region . And this system shapes the jet streams that guide weather and storms around the world .\n\nThat 's how it works under normal conditions , anyway . But things look a little different when El Niño comes along .\n\n2 ) Now along comes El Niño\nEvery few years , those prevailing Pacific trade winds that blow east to west can weaken . ( Scientists are still debating the nuances of exactly why this happens . )\n\nWhen the trade winds weaken , all that warm water that was piled up near Indonesia starts sloshing back eastward , pulled back down by gravity . What 's more , the underwater layer known as the thermocline starts sinking . As a result , there 's less cold water rising up from the deep ocean near South America — so the waters near Peru start warming up . Here 's another diagram :\n\nThis causes sea surface temperatures in the east and central Pacific to start rising and the trade winds to weaken even further . What 's more , rainfall starts following that warm pool of water as it travels eastward . That 's why El Niño is usually associated with drier weather in places like Indonesia and Australia , as well as heavier rains in places like Peru ( or California ) . The rain is essentially moving east .\n\nScientists officially declare an El Niño when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean ( known as the Niño 3.4 region ) rise 0.5°C above their historical baseline for three months in a row — and once atmospheric conditions and rainfall patterns shift accordingly .\n\nAgain , because the Pacific is so vast , an El Niño can have large ripple effects on weather around the world , especially during the winter months . Here 's a look at the changes that have historically accompanied El Niño events :\n\nTypical effects of an El Niño during the winter :\n\nA strong El Niño can weaken monsoons in the Indian Ocean , for example . It can also cause the jet stream to start stretching from the Eastern Pacific across the southern United States , bringing rainfall and storms with it . Still , a lot depends on how strong the El Niño actually is — and occasionally there are aberrations and exceptions to the rule . More on that below .\n\nEl Niño 's return in 2015 — and why scientists have been talking about a `` Godzilla '' event\nEver since early 2014 , scientists have been expecting this latest El Niño to form . But , in a sign of how slippery the system can be , El Niño kept defying predictions and not showing up .\n\nFinally , in March 2015 , after several false starts , scientists at NOAA 's climate prediction center were ready to declare that a weak El Niño was underway . Specifically , sea surface temperatures in that Niño 3.4 region ( roughly in the center of the chart below ) had been at least 0.5°C above their baseline since September . And , importantly , atmospheric conditions were responding in turn , with more rain over the central Pacific and less rain over Indonesia :\n\nAt the time , however , NOAA 's forecasters said that this El Niño looked `` weak , '' with possibly minimal effects on global weather patterns , and only had a 50 to 60 percent chance of lasting through the summer .\n\nThen , somewhat unexpectedly , El Niño kept getting stronger and stronger . And stronger . By October 2015 , sea surface temperatures had soared to more than 2°C above baseline in the Niño 3.4 region , and scientists were seeing strong telltale atmospheric changes . Notice how the anomalous warm area has moved east and is much , much warmer than usual :\n\nForecasters now expect this El Niño to peak between October and January , and when it does , it 's likely to rank among the two or three strongest ever record ( along with 1997-'98 , 1982-'83 , and 1972-'73 . ) Some forecasters have even dubbed this one a potential `` Godzilla . ''\n\nWe 're already started to see some major El Niño impacts around the world . A paucity of rainfall in Indonesia this fall allowed manmade forest and peat fires to rage out of control , choking the region in a thick toxic haze . And the warmer Pacific waters have fostered an unusually active tropical cyclone season , a hallmark of El Niño . On the flip side , however , the event has also fostered more wind shear in the Atlantic that has curtailed hurricane activity there .\n\nEl Niño could bring rain to California — but may not end the drought\nAs noted above , El Niño tends to be associated with changes in weather patterns around the world , especially during the Northern Hemisphere winter . One tantalizing possibility is that a strong El Niño will bring more rain to California , alleviating the state 's drought .\n\nBut even here , nothing is certain . El Niño only affects US weather indirectly , by altering atmospheric circulation and shifting the North Pacific jet stream . ( See here for a lucid explanation by Columbia University 's Anthony Barnston . ) This is an intricate chain of events , and small kinks at certain points can affect the ultimate outcome .\n\nAs such , Becker cautions people to think not in terms of certainties but in terms of probabilities . Here 's an example of how El Niño might shift the odds of a wetter-than-average winter for California ( she notes that this is n't a prediction , just an illustration ) :\n\nIn other words , thanks to El Niño , California has a greater chance of a wetter winter , but not a 100 percent chance .\n\nWhat 's more , even if rain does come , that may not be enough to completely erase the massive water deficit that California has built up over the past five years . The state likely needs record precipitation to end the drought , and it also needs the right mix of rain ( to recharge the reservoirs ) and snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains ( to melt during the spring and summer ) .\n\nAlso , be warned : Heavy rain after a drought can bring floods and mudslides . Southern California got a possible preview in mid-October , when a short burst of intense rains led to major mudflows that trapped hundreds of cars . So people need to be ready .\n\nEl Niño tends to hurt some countries and benefit others\nIt 's not quite right to say that El Niño events are `` bad '' or `` good . '' They tend to have different impacts on different regions .\n\nOne recent study from the University of Cambridge found that on average , El Niño events hurt economic activity in Australia , Chile , Indonesia , India , Japan , New Zealand , and South Africa . The reasons varied : drought and reduced crop yields in Australia and India , forest fires in Indonesia , less productive fisheries in Peru .\n\nBut that study also found that on average , El Niño tended to boost the economies in Argentina , Canada , Mexico , and even the United States , at least in the very short term . Again , many factors were at play : In addition to bringing needed rain to California and Texas , El Niño was associated with less tornado activity in the midwestern United States and fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean .\n\nHere 's a table of the estimated economic impacts on a broad selection of countries :\n\nAgain , every big El Niño is different and has its own idiosyncrasies . So think of this table as more a rough guide than gospel .\n\nThere are also two important twists here . As the WMO 's Michel Jarraud stressed in his October news conference , many countries have learned from the past and implemented measures to guard against El Niño 's impacts . ( Mexico , for instance , was well-prepared for a record-strength Pacific hurricane that hit the state last month . )\n\nConversely , this El Niño is also playing out in the context of record warm ocean temperatures , so it could have unpredictable impacts . `` Our scientific understanding of El Niño has increased greatly in recent years . However , this event is playing out in uncharted territory , '' said Jarraud . `` This naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced . ''\n\nEl Niño is helping make 2015 a record hot year . What about 2016 ?\nThanks to global warming , the Earth 's average surface temperature has been going up over time . But there 's a lot of variation from year to year . El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average . La Niña years ( when those trade winds strengthen rather than weaken ) tend to be a bit cooler than average . Like so :\n\nWhat 's going on here ? As humans load more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , we 're trapping more and more heat on the Earth 's surface . But more than 90 percent of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans . So subtle interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can make a big difference for surface temperatures .\n\nWhen conditions in the Pacific are neutral , more of that heat is trapped beneath the ocean surface . When a strong El Niño forms , more of that heat is transferred to the surface . That 's why the Earth 's average surface temperatures reached new highs in 1998 : You had the combination of global warming and an extremely strong El Niño .\n\nWhat was remarkable about 2014 is that it was likely the hottest year on record even without an El Niño event — a sign that Earth keeps getting warmer overall . Meanwhile , 2015 is basically guaranteed to be even hotter than 2014 .\n\nNow throw a monster El Niño into the mix , and we 're looking at a potential shattering of records . Back in January , NASA 's Gavin Schmidt explained at a press conference that temperatures typically peak about three months after an El Niño event . Given that forecasters expect this current El Niño to last until next spring , it 's entirely possible we could see 2016 also set new highs . We 'll have to wait and see .", "label": [], "source_url": "https://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164499/el-nino-2015", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/brad-plumer-el-nino-explained-why-this-years-could-be-one-of-the-strongest-on-record/"}
{"id": 566, "data": "Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan . Some snapshots : In just the past few months , record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people . In Washington state ’ s Olympic National Park , the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory . London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K. ; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated . In California , suffering from its worst drought in a millennium , a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours , jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic . Then , a few days later , the region was pounded by intense , virtually unheard-of summer rains . Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean , shifting weather patterns worldwide .\n\nOn July 20th , James Hansen , the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public ’ s attention in the summer of 1988 , issued a bombshell : He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted : 10 feet by 2065 . The authors included this chilling warning : If emissions aren ’ t cut , “ We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable . Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating . It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable , threatening the fabric of civilization . ”\n\nEric Rignot , a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen ’ s study , said their new research doesn ’ t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise , it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss , especially among world leaders . In particular , says Rignot , the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “ safe ” level of climate change — “ would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise . ”\n\nHansen ’ s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be . Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history , some parts of the ocean , near where ice is melting exceptionally fast , are actually cooling , slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy . Sure enough , a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland , exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be . Michael Mann , another prominent climate scientist , recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown , “ This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding . ”\n\nSince storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures , the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound . Storms will get stronger , and sea-level rise will accelerate . Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come , though Mann said it was still “ unclear ” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon .\n\nAnd yet , these aren ’ t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth ’ s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year . For that , you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves .\n\nWater temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life .\n\nRelated : Apocalypse Soon : 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom\n\nEighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco . On an excursion earlier this year , Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales . During a survey on July 4th , federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning . Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California , but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers . Why are they coming so close to shore ? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water . The whales are having a heyday . “ It ’ s unbelievable , ” Thomas told a local paper . “ Whales are all over\nthe place . ”\n\nLast fall , in northern Alaska , in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil , federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach . It was the largest-ever documented “ haul out ” of walruses , and a sign that sea ice , their favored habitat , is becoming harder and harder to find .\n\nMarine life is moving north , adapting in real time to the warming ocean . Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay , California , the farthest north that ’ s ever been known to occur . A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range . Across California , there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north , such as Mexican red crabs .\n\nNo species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest , the salmon . Every two weeks , Bill Peterson , an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’ s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon , takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon . What he ’ s been seeing this year is deeply troubling .\n\nSalmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet . A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon , which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs . The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn ’ t exist without salmon .\n\nBut their situation is precarious . This year , officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks , because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving . One species , the winter-run Chinook salmon , is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years , should the warm water persist offshore .\n\n“ You talk to fishermen , and they all say : ‘ We ’ ve never seen anything like this before , ’ ” says Peterson . “ So when you have no experience with something like this , it gets like , ‘ What the hell ’ s going on ? ’ “\n\nAtmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century . Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years , during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO . It also makes big El Niños , like this year ’ s , more likely . The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven ’ t yet figured out precisely what ’ s behind them and why they happen when they do . It ’ s not a permanent change — the ocean ’ s temperature will likely drop from these record highs , at least temporarily , some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting , and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview .\n\n“ The climate [ change ] models predict this gentle , slow increase in temperature , ” says Peterson , “ but the main problem we ’ ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high . As scientists , we can ’ t keep up with it , and neither can the animals. ” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round : “ At some point , you knock them down , and the fight is over . ”\n\nAttendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean ’ s food chain . In July , another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “ quite traumatic ” impact on plankton diversity , with some species dying out while others flourish . As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , it ’ s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines . According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT , that trend means “ the whole food chain is going to be different . ”\n\nThe Hansen study may have gotten more attention , but the Dutkiewicz study , and others like it , could have even more dire implications for our future . The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes , actually , we ’ re heading toward the worst-case scenario . Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away , the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale .\n\nJacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine . She knows a lot about extinction , and her work is more relevant than ever . Essentially , she ’ s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren ’ t . The ancient data she studies shows “ really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans . We ’ re talking less than a decade . ”\n\nFor the past year or two , a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “ the blob ” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii , Alaska and Baja California that ’ s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin . Amid warmer temperatures , plankton numbers have plummeted , and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle .\n\nSignificant northward surges of warm water have happened before , even frequently . El Niño , for example , does this on a predictable basis . But what ’ s happening this year appears to be something new . Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years , which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck .\n\nA similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years . An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that ’ s persisted for most of the past 18 months . Daniel Swain , a Stanford University meteorologist , has called it the “ Ridiculously Resilient Ridge ” — weather patterns just aren ’ t supposed to last this long .\n\nWhat ’ s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems , the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years , or longer . The largest ocean on Earth , the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins . While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world ’ s oceans , it ’ s not alone : Globally , 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures , and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly , boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific . Six percent of the world ’ s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade , perhaps permanently , thanks to warming waters .\n\nSince warmer oceans expand in volume , it ’ s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise . One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents , perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland , that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years , from 2009 to 2010 . To be sure , it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary , but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event , and it ’ s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “ almost as significant as some hurricane events . ”\n\nPossibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters . Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies : A striking study last year showed that , along the West Coast , the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving , with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem . One of the study ’ s authors , Nina Bednaršek , told Science magazine that the snails ’ shells , pitted by the acidifying ocean , resembled “ cauliflower ” or “ sandpaper. ” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world ’ s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “ effectively irreversible ” change on ocean ecosystems during this century . In as little as a decade , the study suggested , chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world ’ s oceans .\n\n“ I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct , ” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013 . “ But this change we ’ re seeing is happening so fast it ’ s almost instantaneous . ”\n\nThanks to the pressure we ’ re putting on the planet ’ s ecosystem — warming , acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change . Here ’ s what could happen next .\n\nThe combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff , abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen . The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate .\n\nSo far , dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts , but in the 21st century , deep-ocean dead zones could become common . These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish , whales , pretty much everything upward . If this were to occur , large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies , pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler , nutrient-rich deeper water .\n\nEnhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours , perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests , and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas , further enhancing dead zones . In the past year , downpours have broken records in Long Island , Phoenix , Detroit , Baltimore , Houston and Pensacola , Florida .\n\nEvidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago , during the “ Great Dying , ” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change . The conditions that triggered “ Great Dying ” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop . But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate , so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start .\n\nWith all these stressors working against it , a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans ’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime . A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover . “ Looking forward for my kid , people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today , ” Moffitt said .\n\nAs you might expect , having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists , and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy . Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece , virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point .\n\nFor Simone Alin , an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA ’ s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle , the changes she ’ s seeing hit close to home . The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world ’ s marine ecosystems .\n\nThe local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse . Alin calls oysters , which are non-native , the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound : “ A canary is also not native to a coal mine , but that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s not a good indicator of change . ”\n\nThough she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day , the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard : “ This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes , then . . . everything could change , right ? ”\n\nAlin ’ s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day . But four years ago , the birth of her twins “ heightened the whole issue , ” she says . “ I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea . Now , it just makes me feel crushed . ”\n\nKatharine Hayhoe , a climate scientist and evangelical Christian , moved from Canada to Texas with her husband , a pastor , precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change . There , she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would . But she ’ s already planning her exit strategy : “ If we continue on our current pathway , Canada will be home for us long term . But the majority of people don ’ t have an exit strategy . . . . So that ’ s who I ’ m here trying to help . ”\n\nJames Hansen , the dean of climate scientists , retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist . But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to , Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful . That ’ s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution : End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible . If tomorrow , the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong , coordinated carbon tax that ’ s also applied to imports , the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up . This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times , with tepid bipartisan support . Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot , for Hansen , even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it . On a conference call with reporters in July , Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris .\n\nOne group Hansen is helping is Our Children ’ s Trust , a legal advocacy organization that ’ s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children , the group argues , are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet .\n\nA separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn ’ t just a pollutant ( which , under the Clean Air Act , can dissipate on its own ) , it ’ s also a toxic substance . In general , these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment , cause an unreasonable risk , and therefore require remediation . In this case , remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground .\n\nEven if these novel challenges succeed , it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable . But maybe that ’ s enough . When all feels lost , saving a few species will feel like a triumph .\n\nOdds are good that the worst wildfire disaster in U.S. history might not happen in the West – but in New Jersey .

{"id": 570, "data": "CNN —\nYou ’ ve probably heard about some of the impacts of rising seas : Nearly a fifth of Bangladesh , in South Asia , could be submerged ; some low-lying islands in the Pacific may disappear ; coastal cities like Miami and New York are expected to see more floods .\n\nBut exactly how and why are the seas rising ?\n\nThe underlying answer , of course , is that humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels , cutting down forests and engaging in other activities that release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere . Policy makers have concluded that the warming would be especially dangerous if it crosses a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius higher than Earth ’ s temperature at the start of the industrial revolution . But for details on how climate change is raising the height of the ocean , I turned to CNN International meteorologist and supervising weather producer Brandon Miller .\n\nBelow you ’ ll find an edited transcript of our email conversation .\n\nI ’ ll be exploring sea-level rise and what happens to people whose homes are flooded this month as part of CNN ’ s “ 2 degrees ” series on climate change . Let me know in the comments at the bottom of this post if there are other sea-level-related questions you ’ d like to see answered . And consider signing up for the “ 2 degrees ” newsletter if you ’ d like to follow along .\n\n1 . Why are sea levels rising ?\nGlobal sea level rise occurs because of two factors . The biggest reason is because of something called “ thermal expansion , ” which is simply that water expands as it warms , just like how the liquid in a thermometer expands as the temperature increases . Therefore , as global temperatures continue to rise , the oceans get warmer and they literally expand , making the level of the sea rise . The other main contributor to sea level rise is the loss of glaciers and the polar ice caps . When the glaciers and ice caps melt , that water flows into the ocean and increases its volume .\n\n2 . Is this already happening – or is it a future thing ?\nYes it is already happening , and yes it will continue to happen in the future , with the rate of sea level rise likely increasing as well . Since 1900 we have seen seas rise , on average , about 20 cm ( 8 inches ) . While ocean levels varied over the past 2,000 years , they did so much more slowly . It would have taken several hundred years to change the ocean level by the amount we have witnessed over the past century , with a bulk of that increase coming in the last 25 years .\n\nThe rate of change in the past 20 years is about double the rate of change over the past 100 years , indicating that the rate of sea level rise is increasing .\n\n3 . What will happen to sea levels if the climate warms 2 degrees ?\nSea levels will certainly continue to rise if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) . Sea level rise will not stop , even if the warming ends at 2 degrees . Instead , it will continue for many centuries due to the lag in response times of the world ’ s oceans and massive ice sheets .\n\nIf we look at the distant past , 120,000 years ago , when only very early humans existed , the temperature was 2 degrees warmer than it is now . Sea levels were about 5 meters ( 16 feet ) higher than they are today . Nearly 500 million people worldwide currently live below 5 meters elevation .\n\n4 . How much are sea levels expected to rise by , say , 2100 ?\nAccording to the latest projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a 2 degree increase in temperature by the end of this century would result in about a half a meter ( 1.5 feet ) of sea level rise . If we drastically and immediately reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we are currently emitting , the sea level will still continue to rise as the result of the warming we have already seen , but it should be less , likely around 40 cm ( 15 inches ) . If we continue increasing greenhouse gas emissions at the current rate , the increase in sea level could be up to double that amount , or 80 cm ( 31 inches ) by 2100 .\n\n5 . What about in the really , really long term ?\nOne of the big questions is how much warming will it take to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet , which contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters ( 23 feet ) . This is an incredibly difficult question to answer , but current research shows it is likely between 1 degree and 4 degrees warming , compared to pre-industrial averages . If 2 degrees is enough to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet , for instance , it could mean sea levels would rise much higher and faster than current projections show . A total melting of Greenland ’ s ice likely would take thousands of years , though .\n\n6 . Are lots of the Pacific islands actually going to disappear ?\nLikely not disappear , at least not in the short term ( through the end of this century ) , but they will be dramatically impacted . Many low-lying regions will see drastic changes to their coastal geography from beach erosion , significant infrastructure challenges from things like saltwater intrusion into the water system , and population displacement from inundation . There are some extreme examples , such as the Marshall Islands , where 99 % of the country lies below 5 meters in elevation , which could literally be “ wiped off the map , ” but the problem is far more wide-reaching than a few tiny Pacific islands . Coastal communities around the world will face higher risks for storm-induced tidal surges , frequent inundation from high tides , etc . Many of the world ’ s largest and most influential cities are located on the coast and must make significant preparations to combat rising sea levels .\n\n7 . What about Bangladesh ? Isn ’ t it very high risk ?\nYes , absolutely . Bangladesh is in a very precarious situation in that it is vulnerable to flooding from all sides as a result of climate change . Increasing sea levels will continuously shrink the low-level coastal communities , while the major rivers that flow through Bangladesh ( Ganges and Brahmaputra ) will face increasing water levels from melting glaciers in the Himalayas . Bangladesh has the eighth largest population of any country – at 158 million – and a majority of these people live in the areas where these rising rivers meet a rising sea .\n\n8 . What ’ s happening to U.S. cities – like New York , NOLA and Miami ?\nThe World Bank recently led a study that ranked cities around the globe in terms of their risk of coastal flooding resulting from climate change . When looking at overall costs of damage , five of the top 10 cities were in the United States : Miami ( 2 ) , New York ( 3 ) , New Orleans ( 4 ) , Tampa ( 7 ) , Boston ( 8 ) . This is largely due to the massive amounts of infrastructure , economic assets and population that are located directly on the coast and at low elevation .\n\nBased on the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment , New York City would see a local sea level rise of nearly 4 feet by 2100 . A 4-foot sea level rise for New York would result in nearly 100,000 people being underwater in New York City alone , with a property value of $ 16.5 billion .\n\n9 . How many people will be displaced by rising seas ?\nIn a 2-degree world , hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding as a result of climate change . Asia , namely East , Southeast , and South Asia will be particularly affected . Unfortunately , some of these regions which will face the largest and most immediate impacts from rising seas have the fewest resources to combat them . In many cases , the cost of coastal adaptation may be too much , flooding from storms pushing higher water levels into homes will become too frequent , or the intrusion of saltwater into the local water table will make growing crops impossible – and people in all regions of the world will be forced to leave their homes and cities .", "label": [[7558, 7873, "Fallacy of Emotion"]], "source_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/opinions/sutter-sea-level-climate/index.html", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/cnn-john-sutter-9-questions-on-rising-seas/"}
{"id": 571, "data": "After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart , prompting a humanitarian emergency , Vanuatu 's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands ' predicament on manmade global warming . The storm , which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history , had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour , with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country . It leveled homes and businesses , and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate , including the capital of Port Vila . The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday , but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world . [ seealso url= '' http : //mashable.com/2014/09/29/global-warming-making-heat-waves-some-droughts-more-common-studies-find/ '' ] “ This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu , ” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan , according to The Guardian . “ It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu . … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out. ” He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change . “ We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons , the warm , the rain , all this is affected , ” he said . So , is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming ? Or is the tie so tenuous that it 's almost nonexistent ? The answer , as it often is in climate science , is far more nuanced than Vanuatu 's president portrays it . Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu . At the same time , rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago . Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate .\nOcean temperatures are the main suspect\nScientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu , aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions . Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) . Some -- but not all -- of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming , according to Kevin Trenberth , a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , as well as other experts .\n\nAccording to Trenberth , about about 0.6 degrees Celsius , or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit , of the ocean temperature anomalies `` can be blamed on human-induced global warming '' while the rest is `` natural '' and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean . El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean . It can alter worldwide weather patterns , including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans . Whatever the cause , though , the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam , as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air . `` The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20 % more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had . The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size , '' Trenberth said in an email conversation . `` The winds are stronger , the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels . '' El Niño `` has played a role here on top of global warming . But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway ( but not this strong ) . The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven 's sake , '' he said . An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948 , although there are considerable uncertainties in this data , says Michael Ventrice , an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts . He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects .\n\n`` The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified , '' Ventrice said .\nMadden and Julian ...\nVentrice says Cyclone Pam `` thrived '' in an environment that was well-suited to explosive intensification . These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean , as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation , or MJO . In certain instances , the MJO can encourage the air to rise , forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones . Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm 's rapid intensification . `` The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper-levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear , both are which parameters that are musts for intensification , '' Ventrice said . [ brightcove video=4114447991001 ]\nFew robust trends in tropical cyclones near Vanuatu\nClimate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to . However , the Southwest Pacific , where Cyclone Pam occurred , is not one of these areas , possibly due to the relative paucity of data there . Kerry Emanuel , a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes , told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu .\n\n`` Ironically , this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics , and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming , '' he said in an email . In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18 , Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing , even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse . `` While Pam and Haiyan , as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters , can not be uniquely pinned on global warming , they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms , '' Emanuel said . Tom Knutson , a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones , the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century . In fact , there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there , based on the most recent computer model simulations , Knutson says . James Elsner , a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth , says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger , like storms elsewhere . But the data is not yet there to prove it . `` We have a pretty solid basis ( physical & empirical ) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger , '' he said . `` Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic . But the signal is hard to see in noisy data , and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones . '' Although global warming signals may not be present yet , multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones ( including hurricanes and typhoons ) to be more intense , on average , than they are today , which means these storms will be more destructive . Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades , according to peer reviewed research . Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding , this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today . As a small , low-lying island nation , Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming . Along with other small island countries , some of which were affected by the same cyclone , Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change , seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation .

{"id": 572, "data": "It is an indisputable fact that carbon emissions are rising—and faster than most scientists predicted . But many climate-change alarmists seem to claim that all climate change is worse than expected . This ignores that much of the data are actually encouraging . The latest study from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that in the previous 15 years temperatures had risen 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit . The average of all models expected 0.8 degrees . So we ’ re seeing about 90 % less temperature rise than expected .\n\nFacts like this are important because a one-sided focus on worst-case stories is a poor foundation for sound policies . Yes , Arctic sea ice is melting faster than the models expected . But models also predicted that Antarctic sea ice would decrease , yet it is increasing . Yes , sea levels are rising , but the rise is not accelerating—if anything , two recent papers , one by Chinese scientists published in the January 2014 issue of Global and Planetary Change , and the other by U.S. scientists published in the May 2013 issue of Coastal Engineering , have shown a small decline in the rate of sea-level increase .\n\nWe are often being told that we ’ re seeing more and more droughts , but a study published last March in the journal Nature actually shows a decrease in the world ’ s surface that has been afflicted by droughts since 1982 .\n\nHurricanes are likewise used as an example of the “ ever worse ” trope . If we look at the U.S. , where we have the best statistics , damage costs from hurricanes are increasing—but only because there are more people , with more-expensive property , living near coastlines . If we adjust for population and wealth , hurricane damage during the period 1900-2013 decreased slightly .\n\nAt the U.N. climate conference in Lima , Peru , in December , attendees were told that their countries should cut carbon emissions to avoid future damage from storms like typhoon Hagupit , which hit the Philippines during the conference , killing at least 21 people and forcing more than a million into shelters . Yet the trend for landfalling typhoons around the Philippines has actually declined since 1950 , according to a study published in 2012 by the American Meteorological Society ’ s Journal of Climate . Again , we ’ re told that things are worse than ever , but the facts don ’ t support this .", "label": [[263, 544, "Ad Populum"], [1169, 1390, "Intentional"], [2095, 2288, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [900, 1165, "Fallacy of Credibility"], [1669, 1773, "Ad Populum"]], "source_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bjorn-lomborg-the-alarming-thing-about-climate-alarmism-1422832462#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20climate%20change%20is,reality%20or%20not%20a%20problem.&text=But%20the%20narrative%20that%20the,from%20focusing%20on%20smart%20solutions.", "climate_feedback_url": "https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-bjorn-lomborg-alarming-thing-climate-alarmism/"}
