These contradictions lead to a confusing definition of fascism allowing for anyone to be opposed by Antifa as having fascistic tendencies/ideologies.Hence, it is true that The sixth characteristic of fascism according to Ur-Fascism - appealing to the frustrated middle class - is exactly what Antifa is doing as well. Typically the distribution of wealth in most societies gravitates towards the middle class being the biggest population, so appealing to the middle class is what any idea needs to do in order to survive and grow. This cannot be an indication of fascism as all ideas, fascist or otherwise, would need support from the middle class in order to grow.",['appeal to emotion']
