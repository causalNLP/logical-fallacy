So it ’ s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reported Tuesday that the first half of 2017 was the second-warmest January-June on record for Earth , topped only by 2016 , which was boosted by one of the biggest El Niños on record . “ As if it wasn ’ t shocking enough to see three consecutive record-breaking years , in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , for the first time on record , ” leading climatologist Michael Mann wrote in an email to ThinkProgress , “ we ’ re now seeing near-record temperatures even in the absence of the El Nino ‘ assist ’ that the previous record year benefited from . ”",appeal to emotion

Moreover , Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear ’ s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears ’ prey .

The study was “ very nicely done , ” she said , but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors . The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide .
