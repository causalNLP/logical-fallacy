Global warming alarmists ’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year ( to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year ) in the United States alone . This appalling death toll occurs every year even while wind power produces just 3 % of U.S. electricity . Ramping up wind power to 10 , 20 , or 30 % of U.S. electricity production would likely increase annual bat kills to 10-to-30 million every year . Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense .

Just as importantly , alarmists present no evidence that global warming caused the summer heat wave in a notoriously hot desert near the equator .

Because if you ’ re lucky , it ’ s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan. ” It was early 2008 , and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming , which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater . The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was , he assured me , a fantasy ; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us . Before the end of this century , 80 % of the world ’ s population would be wiped out .

Indeed , NASA satellite instruments have documented a spectacular greening of the Earth , with foliage gains most prevalent in previously arid , semi-desert regions . For people experiencing an increase in vegetation in previously barren regions , this greening of the Earth is welcome and wonderful news . For global warming alarmists , however , a greener biosphere is terrible news and something to be opposed . This , in a nutshell , defines the opposing sides in the global warming debate . Global warming alarmists claim a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is horrible and justifies massive , economy-destroying energy restrictions .

At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world ’ s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat . Things almost certainly won ’ t get that hot this century , though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually . This century , and especially in the tropics , the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees . The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature , which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds : the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it ’ s swung around in the air ( since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air , this single number reflects both heat and humidity ) . At present , most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius ; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees . What is called heat stress comes much sooner .

Actually , we ’ re about there already . Since 1980 , the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat ; a bigger increase is to come . The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002 , and soon , the IPCC warns , simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe . Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming , cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable , annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015 . At four degrees , the deadly European heat wave of 2003 , which killed as many as 2,000 people a day , will be a normal summer . At six , according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley , and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone , anywhere , in the world today . As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change : What Everyone Needs to Know , heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain , one of the planet ’ s hottest spots , and the temperature in Bahrain “ would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans. ” The high-end IPCC estimate , remember , is two degrees warmer still . By the end of the century , the World Bank has estimated , the coolest months in tropical South America , Africa , and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century . Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem ; plus , the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside , it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world , many of them also the poorest . And indeed , the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf , where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit .

At present , more than a third of the world ’ s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God , or else we ’ d have that much more warming already . But the result is what ’ s called “ ocean acidification , ” which , on its own , may add a half a degree to warming this century . It is also already burning through the planet ’ s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place . You have probably heard of “ coral bleaching ” — that is , coral dying — which is very bad news , because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people . Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly , too , though scientists aren ’ t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat ; they do know that in acid waters , oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells , and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans ’ pH has over the past generation , it induces seizures , comas , and sudden death .

That isn ’ t all that ocean acidification can do . Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “ anoxic , ” first in deep ocean “ dead zones , ” then gradually up toward the surface . There , the small fish die out , unable to breathe , which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive , and the feedback loop doubles back . This process , in which dead zones grow like cancers , choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries , is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia , where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “ Skeleton Coast. ” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry , but today it ’ s more apt than ever . Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the tiniest , safest traces of it , which is why our noses are so exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence . Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died , once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt — it ’ s the planet ’ s preferred gas for a natural holocaust . Gradually , the ocean ’ s dead zones spread , killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of millions of years , and the gas the inert waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land . Plants , too . It was millions of years before the oceans recovered .

This storm , like others that have come before it -- from a massive deluge that flooded Oklahoma City to a flooding event in Houston , both of which occurred earlier this year -- are examples of how the atmosphere is behaving in new ways now that there 's more water vapor and heat for weather systems to work with .

The issue now is that these events are even more severe than they otherwise would have been . And they are becoming more frequent in many areas . Though there are significant limits on what climate scientists can say at this point about an event like the South Carolina floods , it 's well-established that global warming has already led to a measurable increase in global atmospheric water vapor levels , and this moisture can be wrung out as heavier bursts of rain or snow . It is also well-established in scientific literature that precipitation is increasingly falling in short , intense bursts rather than long-lasting , generally lighter events .

The risk for extreme precipitation events is increasing in many parts of the world . One study , for example , showed that a 1-in-100 year winter-rainfall event in parts of the United Kingdom is already occurring more frequently , becoming a 1-in-80 year event .

We don ’ t . CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all .

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred . It should go without saying that if scientists can not yet make accurate predictions about future climate change , then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete .

But the drowning of those homelands is just the start . At present , more than a third of the world ’ s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God , or else we ’ d have that much more warming already .

You have probably heard of “ coral bleaching ” — that is , coral dying — which is very bad news , because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people . Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly , too , though scientists aren ’ t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat ; they do know that in acid waters , oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells , and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans ’ pH has over the past generation , it induces seizures , comas , and sudden death .

The IPCC reports also don ’ t fully account for the albedo effect ( less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight , hence more warming ) ; more cloud cover ( which traps heat ) ; or the dieback of forests and other flora ( which extract carbon from the atmosphere ) . Each of these promises to accelerate warming , and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years . The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet ’ s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . *

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into . Unless you are a teenager , you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids . In fact , all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas . The most notorious was 252 million years ago ; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees , accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic , and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead . We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate ; by most estimates , at least ten times faster . The rate is accelerating . This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said , this spring , that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive , and what drove Elon Musk , last month , to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years . These are nonspecialists , of course , and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I . But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field , few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion , too : No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster .

Over the past few decades , the term “ Anthropocene ” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now , and a way to signal that it is a new era , defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention . One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature ( and even echoes the biblical “ dominion ” ) . And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world , which we surely have , it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it , engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries , perhaps until it destroys us . That is what Wallace Smith Broecker , the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “ global warming , ” means when he calls the planet an “ angry beast. ” You could also go with “ war machine. ” Each day we arm it more .",fallacy of credibility

One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup ( now at Polar Bears International , an NGO ) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice , despite the Beaufort Sea experience . Moreover , Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear ’ s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears ’ prey .

Consequently , many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals ( the primary prey of polar bears ) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season , which is particularly conducive to fishing : These seals do most of their feeding in summer . More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’ s probably true throughout the Arctic .",fallacy of credibility

Icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet every year , with or without global warming , particularly in the Antarctic summer . However , a particular iceberg – no matter how large – breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet does not necessarily result in “ Shrinking Glaciers ” as EDF alleges . To the contrary , the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been growing at a steady and substantial pace ever since NASA satellites first began measuring the Antarctic ice sheet in 1979 . Indeed , during the same year that the EDF claims “ an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago ” broke off the Antarctic ice sheet and caused “ Shrinking Glaciers , ” the Antarctic ice sheet repeatedly set new records for its largest extent in recorded history . Those 2013 records were repeatedly broken again in 2014 . The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history , and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking .

The EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs .

So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away .

Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year .

The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I ’ m thinking , for example , of my personal bete noir , the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse , former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity , the preserve of a few cranks , championed only by people who don ’ t do the science . But this is just ugly propaganda .",equivocation

The Clinton administration ’ s plan to turn forests in the West into pristine land free of human interference risked fueling “ wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn , the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire , ” Zybach , who is based in Oregon , told Evergreen magazine in 1994 , when the NWFP came into effect .
Western Oregon had one major fire above 10,000 acres between 1952 and 1987 , reports show . The Silver Complex Fire of 1987 snapped that streak after torching more than 100,000 acres in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area , killing rare plants and trees the federal government sought to protect from human activities .",appeal to emotion
1207,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over,"Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock ’ s passionate support for nuclear power . But , like fracking , he says , it offers only “ a stopgap ” solution . “ Because in the long term , they ’ ll use up all the uranium. ” How long would that take ? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic , as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys .

“ Let ’ s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years , something in that range . It might be 100 . When you ’ ve used all that up , you go to thorium , and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so , shall we say , about 200 years ? ” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels . “ It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed , ” but it won ’ t happen “ because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up ” . So for now , nuclear energy is the only viable option .

But all this , he clarifies cheerfully , is more or less academic . “ Because quite soon – before we ’ ve reached the end of this century , even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over. ” Robots will rule the world ? “ Well , yes . They ’ ll be in charge. ” In charge of us ? “ Yes , if we ’ re still here . Whether they ’ ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise , I have no idea . ”",fallacy of logic

Australia ’ s energy crisis is based on a flawed fundamental . Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions . It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming . If it were shown , it would also have to be shown that the 97 per cent of emissions from natural processes such as ocean degassing , volcanoes , natural chemical reactions and exhalation don ’ t drive global warming .

In the geological past , Earth ’ s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes .

1018,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef/535536/,"To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large , note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest . The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle , the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day . Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows , and the cows will convert the beans to meat , and the humans will eat the meat . In the process , the cows will emit much greenhouse gas , and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat , meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people .

This inefficient process happens on a massive scale . Brazil , the world ’ s largest exporter of red meat , holds around 212 million cattle . ( In June , the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses , collections of pus , in the meat . ) According to the United Nations , 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock . Even more , 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock . In all , almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products .

This means much less deforestation and land degradation if so many plant crops weren ’ t run through the digestive tracts of cattle . If Americans traded their beef for beans , the researchers found , that would free up 42 percent of U.S. crop land .",fallacy of logic

Sure enough , before Christmas , a report from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was greeted with such headlines as “ Hottest Arctic on record triggers massive ice melt ” . In March we had the BBC trumpeting another study that blamed vanishing Arctic ice as the cause of weather which led to the worst-ever smog in Beijing , warning that it “ could even threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 ” .

But last week we were brought back to earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute ( DMI ) , as charted by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Notalotofpeopleknowthat , with the news that ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago . Furthermore , whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin , this year most has been at least two metres thick . The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years .

As for those record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño , the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that 0.6 degrees : just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño had also made 1998 the “ hottest year on record ” .",intentional
