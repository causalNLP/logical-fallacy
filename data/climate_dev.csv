The study was “ very nicely done , ” she said , but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors . The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide . And , as the Arctic continues to warm , soils might not retain as much water , as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way , she noted .
