Overzealous fire suppression across California are helping to build up wildland fuels , which contribute to wildfires , according to Tim Ingalsbee , a fire ecologist who began a career in the 1980s as a wildland firefighter . The solution is “ to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load , ” he told ProPublica in August .
“ It ’ s just … well … it ’ s horrible . Horrible to see this happening when the science is so clear and has been clear for years . I suffer from Cassandra syndrome , ” Ingalsbee said , referring to the Cassandra Syndrome , a Greek metaphor people use when they believe their valid warnings are not heeded .

The idea is that climate change doesn ’ t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves , say , or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself . By altering massive planet-scale air patterns like the jet stream ( pictured above ) , which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere , a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place .",appeal to emotion

In 1990 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries , said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace , that the methane-laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing , and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable .",intentional

The realization that the global climate can swing between warm and cold periods in a matter of decades or even less came as a profound shock to scientists who thought those shifts took hundreds if not thousands of years . Scientists knew major volcanic eruptions or asteroid strikes could affect climate rapidly , but such occurrences were uncommon and unpredictable . Absent such rare events , changes in climate looked steady and smooth , a consequence of slow-moving geophysical factors like the earth ’ s orbital cycle in combination with the tilt of the planet ’ s axis , or shifts in the continental plates .",intentional
