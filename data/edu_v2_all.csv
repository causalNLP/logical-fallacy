There is strong movement from people who choose not to consume meat, and their reasons vary from the healthiness to the effort of making the body looks appropriate or ideal. This is a rather ludicrous idea.

There are no cases when consuming meat causing severe problems, provided meat is consumed in appropriate amount, for everyone. Many say that being a vegan means having a healthier, stronger body and mind. Actualy, according to studies, our bodies are perfectly capable of digesting, absorbing and making full use of the many beneficial nutrients found in animal foods. Thus, there is no health reason to completely avoid animal foods.

2217," Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

3473,"The bomb(s) were also dropped, in part, out of racial prejudices against the Japanese people, which had escalated in American society following the attack of Pearl Harbor.The war with Japan started, in part, due to Japanese racial prejudices against the West, which is why Imperialist Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the first place. Thus, both sides are equally guilty/innocent of race-based military posturing.",['false equivalence']
3474,"The government is not the right actor to fix the gender pay gap.Government intervention, such as legislation, has been necessary in resolving other matters of discrimination, such as race-based discrimination.",['false equivalence']
3475,"Allowing people to insult, harass, and stereotype other people in the open helps the harassment spread.The Nazis' ideas got out in the open where they could be combated. Then they got elected.",['false equivalence']
3476,"A broadly accepted PC culture won't eliminate hate speech, because instead of allowing those bad ideas out in the open, and combatting them with better ideas, you're simply driving hate speech underground and making it part of the counterculture.The Nazis' ideas got out in the open where they could be combated. However, they got elected after that.",['false equivalence']
3477,"Vegan diets not only potentially harm our bodies but the majority result in eating imported, high environmental footprint foods, that require massive amounts of crop land. Good livestock husbandry can actually heal and protect land.Some vegan foods use more water than beef. In fact the food that uses the most water to make per pound is vanilla. Even chocolate uses more water to grow than beef. To heal the planet the consumption of all three of these foods should be lowered.",['false equivalence']
3478,"Parents may pass their religion on to their children, but they do not have the right to let religion get in the way of or mixed up with education. They should happen as separately as possible, as faith jeopardizes the logical and critical thinking required by actual knowledge.Faith (worldview) and education cannot be separated, and those who claim otherwise merely hide their faith, or worldview, behind presuppositions taught as absolute truth. Often this leads to a more chaotic and dissonant attempt at education, as individual educators and institutions try to present their own worldviews as assertions reconciled to tolerance and openness. Religious education, on the other hand is, is open and honest about foundational presuppositions, therefore easier to critique.",['false equivalence']
3479,"Prime numbers exist and are well-defined even without anyone storing them anywhere, or even defining them.We can say prime numbers are ""implicite information"", as in, can be calculated from what you already have. But in the same way, all that happens in the material world (including nuclear fission) can be a predictable thing, and by calling any predictables a non-information (but a consequence of the predictors), you get a definition of the universe that doesn't answer any further questions, therefore pointless.",['false equivalence']
3480,Archaeology: Archaeological evidence does not support various aspects of the Book of Mormon's narrative.Civilizations/communities have been found using archaeology in the Americas that should be far harder to find than the massive Book of Mormon civilizations.,['false equivalence']
3481,"Taxation is theft because for many citizens it is collected without their consent and thus violates their property rights.A debt is only valid if the debtor agrees to pay the creditor. Imagine if I left a new car in your driveway that you didn't want and didn't ask for, and then I made a legal claim that you owe me $30,000. This is effectively how taxation works. Services are rendered involuntarily, then payment is demanded. That is not a lawful transaction.",['false equivalence']
3482,Feminism isn't meant to include other groups as there are already agendas in place to support these groups.There are support groups and social justice organizations for most minority groups.,['false equivalence']
3483,Lack of respect for sovereigntyMexico has previously permitted the USA to use drones in their country. It is likely that will be amenable to the continued use of these drones.,['false equivalence']
3484,"Identity politics are detrimental to society.If you replace ""Identity politics is detrimental"" with ""Jewish people are detrimental"" and return to the 1930s, you have the rise of fascism in Europe. People advocating for their own human rights should not be equated with being detrimental to society and therefore should not be squashed or silenced or worse.",['false equivalence']
3485,"One cannot justify shooting a person in the chest and killing them by saying ""Well they should have had a bullet-proof vest!"" Consequently, one cannot justify any harm caused by running an ad-blocker by saying ""well you should have had tools to combat ad-blockers!""One can justify BlockBuster going out of business by saying ""well, they should have adapted to changing market conditions!"" Consequently, one can justify any harm caused by running an ad-blocker by saying ""well, you should have understood your target demographic better and adapted to changing market conditions!""",['false equivalence']
3486,"This fundamentally claims that intelligent people should have more rights that less intelligent people, which is a deplorable way to view humanity.Public facilities and privileges are often privy to barriers. For example, a person only has the right to go to a state college if they score high enough on their SATs.",['false equivalence']
3487,"This mistakenly assumes that pleasure and pain are mutually exclusive feelings.Some people enjoy pain, which indicates that not everyone is hardwired to feel that suffering is always bad.",['false equivalence']
3488,Individual liberty may be a necessary sacrifice depending on the severity of the risk to the public's health.Protecting the liberty of individuals who do not want to vaccinate themselves (or their children) may conflict with protecting the liberty of other individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons (e.g. immunodeficiency) to safely use public spaces due to the increased risk to their health.,['false equivalence']
3489,"Farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.There are many things that people do that have negative impacts on the environment which we would not want to complete stop doing.  For example, farming plants and trees, mining for construction, manufacturing of consumer electronics, etc. The negative impacts on the environment of farming animals is not a sufficient reason for the contention that all meat consumption should stop.",['fallacy of relevance']
3490,"Both sayings are equally harmful, as they each reduce complex issues to hollow and divisive platitudes.It's not only black people who have suffered hardship. Other races, including white people, have had their fair share of hardship. Singling out ""black lives"" is unfair.",['fallacy of relevance']
